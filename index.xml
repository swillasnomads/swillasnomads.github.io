Thankfully though Will took a look at the weather forecast and it was supposed to be POURING (like over 125mm of rain per day) in Milford Sound over May 7-9. Given we had no accommodations booked and our boat ride was changeable we changed course.</description></item><item><title>May 3-6: NZ South Island pt. 1</title><link>https://swillasnomads.github.io./posts/may3-6_nz_s1/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Jan 2022 19:41:01 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://swillasnomads.github.io./posts/may3-6_nz_s1/</guid><description>Post 16: Settling into a van It will be hard to encapsulate our time in New Zealand with my limited ability with words. Campervaning in the south island for over 2 weeks has been a highlight of the trip, and non-ironically, my life. The collection of South Island Blog posts will not be short - apologies in advance.

Melbourne is another incredibly vibrant city. We had an absolute blast visiting and playing tourist. We went to see an Aussie Rules Football game which was incredibly entertaining.</description></item><item><title>Apr 24-28: Video</title><link>https://swillasnomads.github.io./posts/apr24-28_video/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Jan 2022 19:41:01 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://swillasnomads.github.io./posts/apr24-28_video/</guid><description> </description></item><item><title>Apr 24-28: Whitsundays</title><link>https://swillasnomads.github.io./posts/apr24-28_whitsundays/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Jan 2022 19:41:01 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://swillasnomads.github.io./posts/apr24-28_whitsundays/</guid><description>Post 14: Rain or Shine We made the decision to head up to the Whitsundays even though the forecast called for rain. We figured if we had a nice airbnb with a view, it would still be nice to relax in warm rainy weather. And I was very much looking forward to the plan being “relax”. Will and I have learned that if you don’t plan for explicit relaxation/chill days, then you don’t get them.</description></item><item><title>Apr 20-23: Video</title><link>https://swillasnomads.github.io./posts/apr20-23_video/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Jan 2022 19:41:01 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://swillasnomads.github.io./posts/apr20-23_video/</guid><description> </description></item><item><title>Apr 20-23: Brisbane</title><link>https://swillasnomads.github.io./posts/apr20-23_brisbane/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Jan 2022 19:41:01 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://swillasnomads.github.io./posts/apr20-23_brisbane/</guid><description>Post 13: Maria and Koalas After spending 4 days in Brisbane, Will and I concluded that Maria was right. Brisbane is a fantastic city to live in but could probably be done in 1 day if you didn’t know anyone in the city.

We owe you one, Maria.</description></item><item><title>Apr 11-19: Video</title><link>https://swillasnomads.github.io./posts/apr13-19_video/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Jan 2022 19:41:01 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://swillasnomads.github.io./posts/apr13-19_video/</guid><description> </description></item><item><title>Apr 11-19: Sydney</title><link>https://swillasnomads.github.io./posts/apr13-19_sydney/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Jan 2022 19:41:01 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://swillasnomads.github.io./posts/apr13-19_sydney/</guid><description>Post 12: Traveling to the other side of the world Leaving Canada for Australia was just a series of unfortunate events. Here are the bullet points to our sob story:
We were scheduled to leave for Melbourne on Thursday april 7th. Given we had both caught covid in the states we each needed a doctor&amp;rsquo;s note clearing us for travel, which were a small headache to obtain. We get to the airport to realize that, duh, we need a visa to enter Australia, but no worries it should only take 10min to obtain.</description></item><item><title>Mar 18-31: The Drive Back</title><link>https://swillasnomads.github.io./posts/mar18-31_drive_back/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Jan 2022 19:41:01 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://swillasnomads.github.io./posts/mar18-31_drive_back/</guid><description>Post 11: There and almost back again. A tale of travel in 2022. I should have been writing this post from the comforts of a Montreal cafe. But alas, it was not meant to be.
On March 18th we set out to drive back across the US over 4 days, stop in to visit friends in Philadelphia, NYC and Vermont before crossing the border back to Canada on March 28th. The drive back itinerary was chosen by optimizing for roughly 7hrs driving days and cheap accommodations close to the highway.</description></item><item><title>Mar 5 - 17: Video</title><link>https://swillasnomads.github.io./posts/mar5-17_video/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Jan 2022 19:41:01 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://swillasnomads.github.io./posts/mar5-17_video/</guid><description> </description></item><item><title>Mar 5-17: Colorado</title><link>https://swillasnomads.github.io./posts/mar5-17_colorado/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Jan 2022 19:41:01 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://swillasnomads.github.io./posts/mar5-17_colorado/</guid><description>Post 10: Converging in Colorado We wrapped up the ski season in Colorado, with 4 final mountains: Beaver Creek, Breckenridge, Keystone and a little known resort called Vail. Fun fact which I learned on this trip, after finding out that one of the founders of Vail (Peter Seibert) was a veteran of the 10th Mountain Division, who fought in Italy during WWII, is that downhill skiing owes its origin in large part to military endeavours (a way to get around more easily in cold mountainous regions).</description></item><item><title>Mar 3 - 4: Video</title><link>https://swillasnomads.github.io./posts/mar3-4_video/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Jan 2022 19:41:01 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://swillasnomads.github.io./posts/mar3-4_video/</guid><description> </description></item><item><title>Mar 3-4: Utah</title><link>https://swillasnomads.github.io./posts/mar3-4_utah/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Jan 2022 19:41:01 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://swillasnomads.github.io./posts/mar3-4_utah/</guid><description>Post 9: Utah Rocks! Though I do hope some people enjoy reading these (often long) blog posts, I will try and keep this one short and encourage everyone to go watch the video Will compiled. It gives a much better idea of the beauty and thrill of these parks. Especially given that describing these trails in words is beyond my artistic ability.

We were finally able to put the shorts we brought to good use! We spent a weekend in San Francisco before driving down Highway 1 to LA over 2 days. The stunning views were endless.
San Francisco (Not to be called San Fran…) We spent a wonderful weekend with Will’s uncle Eric and his husband Philip in their beautiful home in San Francisco.</description></item><item><title>Feb 16-24: Video</title><link>https://swillasnomads.github.io./posts/feb16-24_video/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Jan 2022 19:41:01 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://swillasnomads.github.io./posts/feb16-24_video/</guid><description> </description></item><item><title>Feb 16-24: Lake Tahoe</title><link>https://swillasnomads.github.io./posts/feb16-24_lake_tahoe/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Jan 2022 19:41:01 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://swillasnomads.github.io./posts/feb16-24_lake_tahoe/</guid><description>Post 7: Entering Heaven The plan: Skiing the 3 mountains we had access to with our epic pass in the region (Heavenly Lake, Kirkwood and North Star).
The reality: Our airbnb was minutes from a chairlift in Heavenly but an hour of winding roads to both Kirkwood and North Star. Naturally we were more inclined to ski Heavenly, and after multiple conversations with strangers on chairlifts, we concluded that Kirkwood was worth a visit and that we could comfortably skip North Star.</description></item><item><title>Feb 12-15: Video</title><link>https://swillasnomads.github.io./posts/feb12-15_video/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Jan 2022 19:41:01 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://swillasnomads.github.io./posts/feb12-15_video/</guid><description> </description></item><item><title>Feb 12-15: Border Crossing</title><link>https://swillasnomads.github.io./posts/feb12-15_border_crossing/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Jan 2022 19:41:01 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://swillasnomads.github.io./posts/feb12-15_border_crossing/</guid><description>Post 6: Crossing that border Our next major destination was Lake Tahoe, our airbnb was reserved on the Nevada side for Feb 16th. We knew we were leaving the hospitality of Will’s family in Vancouver on the 13th, but until the 12th, we didn’t yet know where we were going to stop along our drive. We crafted a plan over lunch at the Naam in Kitsilano. We would sleep our first night in Astoria, Oregon.</description></item><item><title>Jan 30-Feb 11: Video</title><link>https://swillasnomads.github.io./posts/jan30-feb11_video/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Jan 2022 19:41:01 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://swillasnomads.github.io./posts/jan30-feb11_video/</guid><description> </description></item><item><title>Jan 30-Feb 11: Whistler, BC</title><link>https://swillasnomads.github.io./posts/jan30-feb11_whistler/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Jan 2022 19:41:01 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://swillasnomads.github.io./posts/jan30-feb11_whistler/</guid><description>Post 5: Whistler Whistler Whistler Whistler… where to begin.
Whistler is one of the biggest ski resorts in North America, it attracts 2M visitors a year (says the first hit on google). We stayed in a small townhouse type complex in Creekside, for 13 nights. Will skied 12 days, and I skied 11.
For those not familiar with this ginormous mountain, it is composed of two peaks: Whistler Mountain and Blackcomb (which merged in 1997).</description></item><item><title>Jan 25-29: Rossland, BC &amp; Vancouver</title><link>https://swillasnomads.github.io./posts/jan25-29_red_van/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Jan 2022 19:41:01 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://swillasnomads.github.io./posts/jan25-29_red_van/</guid><description>Post 4: Will has Family Too Over the next week we would complete our drive out to the coast, officially completing the westward drive, but beforehand we had another family stop to make in Rossland, BC, home of Red Mountain and Will’s first cousin once removed Margie and her husband Robert.
Margie &amp;amp; Robert’s Hospitality We were absolutely spoiled in Rossland for 4 days. We owe Margie and Robert a huge thank you for housing us, feeding us, entertaining us with stories, showing us the mountain and the town.</description></item><item><title>Jan 11-27: Video</title><link>https://swillasnomads.github.io./posts/jan11-27_video/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Jan 2022 19:41:01 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://swillasnomads.github.io./posts/jan11-27_video/</guid><description> </description></item><item><title>Jan 18-24: Fernie, BC</title><link>https://swillasnomads.github.io./posts/jan17-24_fernie/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Jan 2022 19:41:01 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://swillasnomads.github.io./posts/jan17-24_fernie/</guid><description>Post 3: Family in Fernie Next stop on this cross Canada skiing journey was Fernie, BC. This small town of roughly 5 thousand people in the summer which doubles in the winter is home to my cousin, Penelope, her husband Mat and their son, my first cousin once removed (a mouthful, I know), Nolan. It is also home to a beautiful ski resort which thankfully for me, offers a wider range of terrain compared to Kicking Horse and so more ways to ease myself into west coast black diamonds.</description></item><item><title>Jan 11-17: Golden, BC</title><link>https://swillasnomads.github.io./posts/jan11-17_golden/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Jan 2022 19:41:01 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://swillasnomads.github.io./posts/jan11-17_golden/</guid><description>Post 2: Kicking Horse Between January 10th and 17th, Will and I had our first week-long stay in Golden, BC.

The sabbatical (aka mini retirement) that we had been planning pretty much since our first date (in October of 2017) was finally becoming a reality. The original plan was to leave on January 5th at night and drive up to Bracebridge, followed by a 13h drive to Thunderbay the next day.</description></item></channel></rss>
