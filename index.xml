Though I do hope some people enjoy reading these (often long) blog posts, I will try and keep this one short and encourage everyone to go watch the video Will (will) compiled. It gives a much better idea of the beauty and thrill of these parks. Especially given that describing these trails in words is beyond my artistic ability.
Zion National Park This park should be on everyoneâ€™s bucket list.</description></item><item><title>Feb 25- Mar 2: Video</title><link>https://swillasnomads.github.io./posts/feb25-mar2_video/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Jan 2022 19:41:01 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://swillasnomads.github.io./posts/feb25-mar2_video/</guid><description>Â </description></item><item><title>Feb 25-Mar 2: SF -> LA</title><link>https://swillasnomads.github.io./posts/feb25-mar2_california/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Jan 2022 19:41:01 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://swillasnomads.github.io./posts/feb25-mar2_california/</guid><description>Post 8: California Dreaming Well if I thought Vancouver was warm in February it is not even comparable to the coast of California. We were finally able to put the shorts we brought to good use! We spent a weekend in San Francisco before driving down Highway 1 to LA over 2 days. The stunning views were endless.
San Francisco (Not to be called San Franâ€¦) We spent a wonderful weekend with Willâ€™s uncle Eric and his husband Philip in their beautiful home in San Francisco.</description></item><item><title>Feb 16-24: Video</title><link>https://swillasnomads.github.io./posts/feb16-24_video/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Jan 2022 19:41:01 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://swillasnomads.github.io./posts/feb16-24_video/</guid><description>Â </description></item><item><title>Feb 16-24: Lake Tahoe</title><link>https://swillasnomads.github.io./posts/feb16-24_lake_tahoe/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Jan 2022 19:41:01 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://swillasnomads.github.io./posts/feb16-24_lake_tahoe/</guid><description>Post 7: Entering Heaven The plan: Skiing the 3 mountains we had access to with our epic pass in the region (Heavenly Lake, Kirkwood and North Star).
The reality: Our airbnb was minutes from a chairlift in Heavenly but an hour of winding roads to both Kirkwood and North Star. Naturally we were more inclined to ski Heavenly, and after multiple conversations with strangers on chairlifts, we concluded that Kirkwood was worth a visit and that we could comfortably skip North Star.</description></item><item><title>Feb 12-15: Video</title><link>https://swillasnomads.github.io./posts/feb12-15_video/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Jan 2022 19:41:01 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://swillasnomads.github.io./posts/feb12-15_video/</guid><description>Â </description></item><item><title>Feb 12-15: Border Crossing</title><link>https://swillasnomads.github.io./posts/feb12-15_border_crossing/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Jan 2022 19:41:01 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://swillasnomads.github.io./posts/feb12-15_border_crossing/</guid><description>Post 6: Crossing that border Our next major destination was Lake Tahoe, our airbnb was reserved on the Nevada side for Feb 16th. We knew we were leaving the hospitality of Willâ€™s family in Vancouver on the 13th, but until the 12th, we didnâ€™t yet know where we were going to stop along our drive. We crafted a plan over lunch at the Naam in Kitsilano. We would sleep our first night in Astoria, Oregon.</description></item><item><title>Jan 30-Feb 11: Video</title><link>https://swillasnomads.github.io./posts/jan30-feb11_video/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Jan 2022 19:41:01 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://swillasnomads.github.io./posts/jan30-feb11_video/</guid><description>Â </description></item><item><title>Jan 30-Feb 11: Whistler, BC</title><link>https://swillasnomads.github.io./posts/jan30-feb11_whistler/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Jan 2022 19:41:01 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://swillasnomads.github.io./posts/jan30-feb11_whistler/</guid><description>Post 5: Whistler Whistler Whistler Whistlerâ€¦ where to begin.
Whistler is one of the biggest ski resorts in North America, it attracts 2M visitors a year (says the first hit on google). We stayed in a small townhouse type complex in Creekside, for 13 nights. Will skied 12 days, and I skied 11.
For those not familiar with this ginormous mountain, it is composed of two peaks: Whistler Mountain and Blackcomb (which merged in 1997).</description></item><item><title>Jan 25-29: Rossland, BC &amp; Vancouver</title><link>https://swillasnomads.github.io./posts/jan25-29_red_van/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Jan 2022 19:41:01 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://swillasnomads.github.io./posts/jan25-29_red_van/</guid><description>Post 4: Will has Family Too Over the next week we would complete our drive out to the coast, officially completing the westward drive, but beforehand we had another family stop to make in Rossland, BC, home of Red Mountain and Willâ€™s first cousin once removed Margie and her husband Robert.
Margie &amp;amp; Robertâ€™s Hospitality We were absolutely spoiled in Rossland for 4 days. We owe Margie and Robert a huge thank you for housing us, feeding us, entertaining us with stories, showing us the mountain and the town.</description></item><item><title>Jan 11-27: Video</title><link>https://swillasnomads.github.io./posts/jan11-27_video/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Jan 2022 19:41:01 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://swillasnomads.github.io./posts/jan11-27_video/</guid><description>Â </description></item><item><title>Jan 18-24: Fernie, BC</title><link>https://swillasnomads.github.io./posts/jan17-24_fernie/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Jan 2022 19:41:01 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://swillasnomads.github.io./posts/jan17-24_fernie/</guid><description>Post 3: Family in Fernie Next stop on this cross Canada skiing journey was Fernie, BC. This small town of roughly 5 thousand people in the summer which doubles in the winter is home to my cousin, Penelope, her husband Mat and their son, my first cousin once removed (a mouthful, I know), Nolan. It is also home to a beautiful ski resort which thankfully for me, offers a wider range of terrain compared to Kicking Horse and so more ways to ease myself into west coast black diamonds.</description></item><item><title>Jan 11-17: Golden, BC</title><link>https://swillasnomads.github.io./posts/jan11-17_golden/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Jan 2022 19:41:01 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://swillasnomads.github.io./posts/jan11-17_golden/</guid><description>Post 2: Kicking Horse Between January 10th and 17th, Will and I had our first week-long stay in Golden, BC. We have purchased an Epic Pass for our skiing adventures, and with said pass we had 7 days of skiing each at all RCR mountains (which includes Fernie, Kicking Horse, Kimberley, ect).

The sabbatical (aka mini retirement) that we had been planning pretty much since our first date (in October of 2017) was finally becoming a reality. The original plan was to leave on January 5th at night and drive up to Bracebridge, followed by a 13h drive to Thunderbay the next day.</description></item></channel></rss>
