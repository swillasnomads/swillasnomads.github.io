Since Will and I weren‚Äôt gallavanting the world over the last month and instead were fully embracing a retired lifestyle we have less to report on an activity basis and more to discuss in terms of conclusions (we had lots of time to reflect).
Having two months in one location with no job was a new experience.

We owe Margie and Robert a huge thank you for housing us, feeding us, entertaining us with stories, showing us the mountain and the town.</description></item><item><title>Jan 11-27: Video</title><link>https://swillasnomads.github.io./posts/jan11-27_video/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Jan 2022 19:41:01 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://swillasnomads.github.io./posts/jan11-27_video/</guid><description>¬†</description></item><item><title>Jan 18-24: Fernie, BC</title><link>https://swillasnomads.github.io./posts/jan17-24_fernie/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Jan 2022 19:41:01 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://swillasnomads.github.io./posts/jan17-24_fernie/</guid><description>Post 3: Family in Fernie Next stop on this cross Canada skiing journey was Fernie, BC. This small town of roughly 5 thousand people in the summer which doubles in the winter is home to my cousin, Penelope, her husband Mat and their son, my first cousin once removed (a mouthful, I know), Nolan. It is also home to a beautiful ski resort which thankfully for me, offers a wider range of terrain compared to Kicking Horse and so more ways to ease myself into west coast black diamonds.</description></item><item><title>Jan 11-17: Golden, BC</title><link>https://swillasnomads.github.io./posts/jan11-17_golden/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Jan 2022 19:41:01 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://swillasnomads.github.io./posts/jan11-17_golden/</guid><description>Post 2: Kicking Horse Between January 10th and 17th, Will and I had our first week-long stay in Golden, BC. We have purchased an Epic Pass for our skiing adventures, and with said pass we had 7 days of skiing each at all RCR mountains (which includes Fernie, Kicking Horse, Kimberley, ect).

The sabbatical (aka mini retirement) that we had been planning pretty much since our first date (in October of 2017) was finally becoming a reality. The original plan was to leave on January 5th at night and drive up to Bracebridge, followed by a 13h drive to Thunderbay the next day.</description></item></channel></rss>
