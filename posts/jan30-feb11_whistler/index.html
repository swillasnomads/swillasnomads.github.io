We stayed in a small townhouse type complex in Creekside, for 13 nights. Will skied 12 days, and I skied 11.</p><blockquote><p>For those not familiar with this ginormous mountain, it is composed of two peaks: Whistler Mountain and Blackcomb (which merged in 1997). At the base of the former is Creekside, a quiet small ski village, at the base of the latter is Whistler Village, the large, dare I say rowdy village.</p></blockquote><p><figure><img src=/img/Jan30-Feb11/trail_map.jpeg></figure> </p><p>So anyways, we stayed in Creekside, we knowingly spent more on this accommodation than anywhere prior or anywhere to come. We wanted to be able to walk to the hill, make our meals and enjoy a comfortable home base to rest our weary bones.</p><p>The quick summary is that we had a blast despite the bad snow conditions, but I highly encourage you to read on. <strong>The theme for this entry is The Good, The Bad and The Ugly</strong> (for those not in the know, like Will, it’s a 1966 Italian epic spaghetti Western film directed by Sergio Leone and starring Clint Eastwood - again first hit on google…).</p><p>Here goes:</p><h3 id=the-good>The Good:</h3><h4 id=all-of-the-friends>All of the friends</h4><p>What made Whistler so special were the people we got to spend our time with, on and off the slopes.</p><p>Raymond drove up from Vancouver on our first ski day, Sunday Jan 30th, to ski one day with us before he went on his own ski trip to Colorado. We experienced quite long lines with Raymond, but all around had a great day getting acclimated to the mountain. Given that a 30cm snow dump was announced for the next day, Raymond turned that one day ski visit into two days (you just have to chase that powder I’ve been told. Though, I wouldn’t know, we’ve barely come across any). And so Raymond became the one and only person to sleep on the bed in the loft of our airbnb so that we could wake up early and hit the slopes for some fresh tracks. Little did I know, people wake up at 5am to line up when there is a lot of fresh snow, so when we showed up at 8h30 (earliest we ever made it out, btw), we were already way behind the curve.</p><p><figure><img src=/img/Jan30-Feb11/lunch_selfie.jpg></figure> </p><p>Though it took us over an 1h30 to get to where we needed to be on the mountain, and lines were long each time we went up, the snow was wonderful, and when you did find fresh snow, it was a truly unparalleled ski feeling (I see why some wake up insanely early to seek it out). I want to quickly thank Raymond for sticking with me on my second day at Whistler, since my deal with Will is he can ditch me when there is fresh snow, so without him, I would have been all alone. That Monday was also the only day we visited the Whistler Glacier, a really beautiful ice cave, and the only day I took off my skis to hike up to a bowl (twice).</p><p><figure><img src=/img/Jan30-Feb11/Raymond_3.jpg></figure> </p><p>For the remainder of our Whistler stay we imposed ourselves on Will’s long time friend Sawyer and her partner Tony, who were very nice in indulging our need for social interaction outside of our relationship. We were able to ski with them for a full day, have drinks at theirs, watch the Canadian men’s soccer match at ours, play a litany of boardgames games (Will did not win all of them ;p) and even swindle ourselves an invitation to a potluck at their place with two new friends Susan and Dylan. I can not outline enough how warm, kind and adventurous Sawyer and Tony both are, we feel so grateful to have stolen so much of their time over those two weeks.</p><p><h4>Sawyer & Tony</h4><div id=myCarousel class="carousel slide" data-ride=carousel><ol class=carousel-indicators><li data-target=#myCarousel data-slide-to=0 class=active></li><li data-target=#myCarousel data-slide-to=1></li><li data-target=#myCarousel data-slide-to=2></li><li data-target=#myCarousel data-slide-to=3></li><li data-target=#myCarousel data-slide-to=4></li></ol><div class=carousel-inner><div class="item active"><img src=/img/Jan30-Feb11/4_gondy.jpeg alt style=width:100%></div><div class=item><img src=/img/Jan30-Feb11/sawyer_tony_game.jpg alt style=width:100%></div><div class=item><img src=/img/Jan30-Feb11/potluck.jpeg alt style=width:100%></div><div class=item><img src=/img/Jan30-Feb11/sawyer_3.jpeg alt style=width:100%></div><div class=item><img src=/img/Jan30-Feb11/will_tony.jpg alt style=width:100%></div></div><a class="left carousel-control" href=#myCarousel data-slide=prev><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left"></span>

We played multiple rounds with Sawyer and Tony and we were also able to rope in both Alex and Rebecca into playing with us too.</p><p><figure><img src=/img/Jan30-Feb11/alex.jpg></figure> </p><p>Alex is our friend from Capital One who’s vacation out west overlapped with our last week in Whistler. His first day skiing, he spotted our jackets on the hill and pulled me aside with an “Excuse me Ma&rsquo;am”, I was surprised anyone was calling me Ma’am. In retrospect, Alex spotting us was an incredibly lucky event given how large the mountain is. From there we made plans to grab drinks later in the week where we played Crokinole and we followed that up with a half day on the slopes skiing a sheet of ice (more on that later).</p><p><figure><img src=/img/Jan30-Feb11/alex_4.jpg></figure> </p><h4 id=ski-lessons>Ski Lessons</h4><p>One of my goals of this sabbatical was to improve my skiing, and how fortunate for me to be traveling with an old ski racer and ski coach. However, after over 10days on snow I still hadn’t had a dedicated few hours of coaching. After some pleading on my end, Will acquiesced my request for some dedicated coaching time. And our lessons became a highlight. I owe Will a big thank you for not charging me for his time and being patient with my learning curve, private lessons are really expensive and it’s not always easy to coach your partner…</p><p><figure><img src=/img/Jan30-Feb11/will_view.jpg></figure> </p><h4 id=accommodations>Accommodations</h4><p>We will remember our time in Whistler foundly due to this cozy little apartment. Given how comfortable we were in the space we ended up spending all our time off the slopes at home, which was both comfortable and a money saver. Though there was no dining room, the airbnb did have a small foldable table we were able to use, which became quite handy for dinners and boardgames. We were able to use the fireplace 3 times over our two weeks, even though the temperature outside hovered around 0 degrees. And the kitchen was fully stocked, allowing us to cook up a storm. Which leads me well into my next and final “Good” segment.</p><p><figure><img src=/img/Jan30-Feb11/will_read.jpg></figure> </p><h4 id=foodies>Foodies</h4><p>This may feel like boasting and I guess it is, but Will and I constantly talk about how well we eat. It&rsquo;s one of our small pleasures in life, making delicious tasting food. And having two weeks in Whistler allowed us to do a big grocery shop, venture away from microwaveable meals and cook up a storm. I made my family’s chili (shoutout to my parents for bringing us a bag of spices in Fernie), we had it 3 times. I made my dad’s spaghetti recipe, which if the Bodanis’ ever read this blog is really their family’s recipe, which is another meal that fed us 3 times. We had Will’s ever changing spanish rice recipe, a chicken peanut stir fry, take out pokey bowls with Sawyer and Tony, roasted vegetables with sausages and delicious stuffed peppers courtesy of Tony & Sawyer. There may have also been a frozen pizza or two thrown in there! I would be remiss if I didn’t mention the incredible sourdough bread we were able to find at the bakery in Creekside. And though the bread costs a small fortune (something about markups in Whistler), it was worth every penny. We bought 3 loaves.</p><p><div style=position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden><iframe src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/h-2oc_pBeHQ style=position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0 allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe></div> </p><h3 id=the-bad>The Bad:</h3><h4 id=long-lines>Long lines</h4><p>I know Whistler is renowned for its long lines, we were warned by both Penelope in Fernie and Robert in Red Mountain but I still wasn’t prepared. Those first two days of skiing where we actually had snow, we had to stand in 20-25min lines per chairlift. Let alone that initial gondola ride up where we definitely stood in line for over 30 mins. Though standing in line is never fun, at least Will and I weren’t paying to ski by the day. Our pass allowed us to ski the hours that pleased us in a day without thinking about it too much. But I would caution those planning a weekend at Whistler where you’re paying anywhere between $170-$190 per day to ski, there is a good chance you leave your ski day not feeling like you got your money’s worth.</p><p><figure><img src=/img/Jan30-Feb11/line2.jpg></figure> </p><h4 id=spring-skiing-in-february>Spring Skiing in February</h4><p>We are slowly coming to terms with the fact that we have been very unlucky with our winter of skiing. The west’s snowfall, though they received lots in December, seems to have dried up in the New Year. After that initial 30cm, Whistler didn’t receive much more than a sprinkle. And worse than that, during our second week of skiing, the peak at a high of 0 degrees, which meant that the whole mountain warmed up, that day of skiing was fully spring skiing (warm and slushy), which is all well and good when it’s really spring and temperatures continue to be mild, but since it is February, the next night fell back to freezing temperatures and we woke up to a mountain of ice. Not dissimilar to what we had experienced in Fernie. Sticking to groomers was the only escape. But even then, I managed to fall on said ice, more about that in “The Ugly”.</p><p><figure><img src=/img/Jan30-Feb11/blue_bird.jpg></figure> </p><h3 id=-the-ugly>& the Ugly:</h3><p>On our last ski day, skiing with Alex and Rebecca, we experienced the iciest conditions we had come across. Any deviation from the groomed runs and you were guaranteed a fall. Naturally, everyone skiing that day was also sticking to the groomed runs, making them quite busy, and many mogulesk terrain was appearing before us.</p><p>Sometime after we had our makeshift lunch on the chairlift, we were going down a busy groomed mogully run, when I started picking up a lot of speed (my motto that day had been less turns the better given how precarious turns were on ice), and I brought that speed into a very choppy mogul area. I did try to dump my speed with a sharp turn/stop but the pressure on my skis and my low dins had both skis ejecting and a Sam skidding/flying across the icy pitch. I’m used to falling, but this fall did scare me. I am very happy I only came away from it with a sore and bruised right side. It could definitely have been worse. Also thankfully for me, Alex and Rebecca were behind me, they witnessed the fall and were able to help me retrieve my skis, bend the breaks of my left ski back into place (somewhere along the fall they had bent in a way that dragged on the snow if I put my boot in) and get me back up on my feet.</p><p>I was very happy to have the next few days to rest as we left Whistler. My leg is still sporting a nice bruise.</p><p><figure><img src=/img/Jan30-Feb11/bruise_collage.jpg></figure> </p><p>The first picture was taken moments after entering our condo, so only really a few hours after my fall, I knew it would be a fascinating bruise, so I documented it over the next few days to share with all of you! I think it’s starting to look better…</p><h3 id=whistler-recommendations>Whistler Recommendations:</h3><ul><li><strong>Samurai Bowl</strong>: The poke bowls were amazing and the Korean fried chicken was also incredibly good.</li><li><strong>BReD</strong>: Only serves organic sourdough products, and the bread loaves really were the best we’ve come across so far. Though I wouldn’t recommend their cinnamon buns.</li></ul></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://swillasnomads.github.io./js/jquery.min.js></script>
