<h1>Jan 7-17: Kicking Horse, Golden, BC</h1>
<h1 id=post-2-kicking-horse>Post 2: Kicking Horse</h1>
<p>Between January 10th and 17th, Will and I had our first week-long stay in Golden, BC. We have purchased an Epic Pass for our skiing adventures, and with said pass we had 7 days of skiing each at all RCR mountains (which includes Fernie, Kicking Horse, Kimberley, ect).</p>

<h2 id=the-original-plan>The original plan:</h2>
<p>Ski 4 days between Kicking Horse, Revelstoke (2 hour drive away) and Lake Louise (1 hour drive away).</p>
<h2 id=the-unexpected>The unexpected:</h2>
<p>Betty, our car, right after we had picked up groceries on our first night in Golden, started showing signs of a problem. She was having a hard time starting and would idle when she had started. Given there was not much we could do at 7pm on a Monday, we put it out of our minds until the next morning.</p>
<p>Tuesday, Jan 11th, was going to be a rest day before we started skiing, and our rest day had just been added a new to do ticket - fix car. We started Betty up in the morning and she started okay, but that relief was short lived, within a few hours she was idling strongly and actually stalled a few times on Will. We had, like anyone would, tried to google our car’s condition, and thought it was potentially a rough idle, which requires a mechanic to fix. Calling around to mechanics we were told it could potentially be dirty fuel. Long story short, we got a fuel conditioner to clean our fuel, drove around with it in our tank and it did not improve the situation. Fast forward to our car being dropped off at the shop at 2pm that day, we get a call at 4h30 with some good and bad news.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Good news: Betty can now run and we’ll be able to take her up to the ski hill</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Bad news: Betty now has a beer can (yup, a litteral beer can - cheers 🍻) placed in the EGR valve, to help control the exhaust to and from the motor. She will run like this for a while, but quite obviously, it is not a long term fix. And we have to be careful going up large hills, because our motor is more likely to overheat (not an ideal thing to hear while in the rockies).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Bad news 2: the part and labor will cost us ~$800, and we’ll need to stop in Cranbrook to get that part installed.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Silver Lining: We&rsquo;re not stuck on the side of the highway and Cranbrook is on the way to our next stop in Fernie!</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id=the-new-plan>The new plan:</h2>
<p>Only ski in Kicking Horse, where we’ve already paid for tickets, and don’t risk having Betty break down on us driving through very winding Rocky mountain roads.</p>
<h2 id=welcome-to-west-coast-skiing-sam>Welcome to west coast skiing, Sam</h2>
<p>Will had skied Kicking Horse before and had loved it. As for myself, I had believed I would plop myself down on a bigger mountain with lots of snow in my new skis and take off ⛷.</p>
<p>Reality was less kind.</p>
<p>Few things I noticed, a black diamond back home is a blue run at Kicking Horse, some bowls (i.e. big areas of skiing) need to be hiked to (there’s no chair… who designed that alpine skiing experience), powder days don’t come around that often, and fog is very prevelant.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>So needless to say, I had a few falls, lost my skis in some snow once and had my coach, Will, run me through more drills. This winter of skiing these bigger mountains is definitely looking like it will be a bigger challenge for me than I had anticipated (especially if I want to keep up with Will), but at the same time it poses a unique opportunity to focus and get better at it. Trying my best to stay positive (not always innate to my personality as most can attest)!</p>
