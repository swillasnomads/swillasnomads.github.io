Thankfully though Will took a look at the weather forecast and it was supposed to be POURING (like over 125mm of rain per day) in Milford Sound over May 7-9. Given we had no accommodations booked and our boat ride was changeable we changed course. We would hit up Queenstown first, followed by Milford Sound.</p><h3 id=the-best-holiday-park-there-ever-was>The best holiday park there ever was</h3><p><figure><img src=/img/May7-11/driftaway_2.jpg></figure> </p><p>We arrived at the Queenstown Driftaway Holiday Park on May 7th. We were thinking of staying 3 nights, but had only booked 1 to make sure we were comfortable there before putting down more money. Within the first hour of being on the grounds we knew we would love it, and so promptly booked our next two nights.</p><p><figure><img src=/img/May7-11/driftaway.jpg></figure> </p><p><figure><img src=/img/May7-11/dinning_room.jpg></figure> </p><p>We kicked things off strong with a visit to a local brewery, Altitude - Will highly recommends it. We went back twice. Given it was almost my birthday, we allowed ourselves more than one drink before sauntering home in the dark (the sun went down at like 5pm) to make ourselves dinner.</p><p><figure><img src=/img/May7-11/altitude.jpg></figure> </p><h3 id=fall-colours>Fall Colours</h3><p><figure><img src=/img/May7-11/sam_settlement.jpg></figure> </p><p>We couldn’t fully escape the rain, it did get to us a little bit on May 8th, but not enough to dampen our spirits. We drove out to Arrowtown to visit an old Chinese Miner’s Settlement and stroll around the picturesque town. The colours are so gorgeous in the fall that the town has a dedicated festival for it in April (<a href=%E2%80%8B%E2%80%8B%E2%80%8B%E2%80%8Bhttps://www.arrowtown.com/our-town/events/akarua-arrowtown-autumn-festival/>Akarua Arrowtown Autumn Festival</a>).
 </p><p><figure><img src=/img/May7-11/will_settlement.jpg></figure> </p><p>We had debated going out for a nice dinner, but ultimately I decided I wanted to eat a cheese platter with a view, so before driving into Queenstown for the first time we stopped at a specialty grocery store to stock up.</p><p><figure><img src=/img/May7-11/arrowtown.jpg></figure> </p><p>Before strolling around Queenstown, I took a quick nap in the van to refuel my energy levels (the benefits of your car being your home, lol). Queenstown is a very touristy town, which I can imagine is normally filled with too many people, but again, we encountered a very toned down version and it was really quite nice.</p><p><figure><img src=/img/May7-11/gardens.jpg></figure> </p><p>We ruined our appetites slightly with ice cream, but it was well worth it, the best sorbet we&rsquo;ve ever had (we went back two more times for the same order).<figure><img src=/img/May7-11/sorbet.jpg></figure> </p><p>We then quickly rushed back to our campsite to have my birthday dinner with a view.</p><p><figure><img src=/img/May7-11/birthday_dinner.jpg></figure> </p><p>The whole day was a birthday to be remembered and I thank everyone who helped make it special, with a particular shout out to Will. My main takeaway is that fall birthdays are better than spring ones.</p><p><figure><img src=/img/May7-11/sam_sunset.jpg></figure> </p><h3 id=onsen-hot-pools>Onsen Hot Pools</h3><p>We took an easy day on the 9th, we had some planning to do, and desperately needed to complete some laundry. In the afternoon we visited Will&rsquo;s friend, Sean Blomfield’s grandparents that lived around the corner for tea, and the best homemade anzac cookies.<figure><img src=/img/May7-11/blomfield.jpg></figure> </p><p>For dinner we had Ferburger. It came recommended by almost anyone who’s been to Queenstown and most blogs I had read. I loved my cajun chicken burger, I would absolutely go back, but Will was underwhelmed by his deluxe burger - which is really saying something. Do with that information what you will.</p><p><figure><img src=/img/May7-11/ferburger.jpg></figure> </p><p>La piece de resistance came at night. The bougie thing I wanted to do for my birthday was a spa experience at Onsen Hot Pools. We splurged on a soak in one of their cedar lined tubs, overlooking the outlines of the mountains in the night sky, followed by a couples massage that wrecked my back in the best way possible. It was such a relaxing, memorable experience, we’ll definitely be back.</p><p><figure><img src=/img/May7-11/onsen.jpg></figure> </p><h3 id=milford-sound>Milford Sound</h3><p>Our boat tour was planned for 1pm and we wanted to give ourselves lots of time to get there, the drive to Milford is notoriously windy and slow (we hit lots of construction which closes one lane at a time). To summarize, though we gave ourselves lots of time to get there, I was pretty stressed in the last hour of missing our boat trip. Happily, we didn’t.</p><p><div id=myCarousel class="carousel slide" data-ride=carousel><ol class=carousel-indicators><li data-target=#myCarousel data-slide-to=0 class=active></li><li data-target=#myCarousel data-slide-to=1></li><li data-target=#myCarousel data-slide-to=2></li><li data-target=#myCarousel data-slide-to=3></li><li data-target=#myCarousel data-slide-to=4></li><li data-target=#myCarousel data-slide-to=5></li><li data-target=#myCarousel data-slide-to=6></li><li data-target=#myCarousel data-slide-to=7></li><li data-target=#myCarousel data-slide-to=8></li></ol><div class=carousel-inner><div class="item active"><img src=/img/May7-11/milford_sound_view.jpg alt style=width:100%></div><div class=item><img src=/img/May7-11/selfie.jpg alt style=width:100%></div><div class=item><img src=/img/May7-11/boat_trip_view.jpg alt style=width:100%></div><div class=item><img src=/img/May7-11/will_boat.jpg alt style=width:100%></div><div class=item><img src=/img/May7-11/milford_lodge.jpg alt style=width:100%></div><div class=item><img src=/img/May7-11/sam_boat.jpg alt style=width:100%></div><div class=item><img src=/img/May7-11/will_reading_van.jpg alt style=width:100%></div><div class=item><img src=/img/May7-11/will_hike_2.jpg alt style=width:100%></div><div class=item><img src=/img/May7-11/waterfall_long.jpg alt style=width:100%></div></div><a class="left carousel-control" href=#myCarousel data-slide=prev><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left"></span>

(I think there are 5 in the picture below - goodluck!)</p><p><figure><img src=/img/May7-11/seals.jpg></figure> </p><p>We were able to walk back to our campsite - Milford Sound Lodge - the only campsite on the other side of the Homer Tunnel. This depression era project is the only reason we’re able to access Milford by road (more on that in the video to come).</p><p><figure><img src=/img/May7-11/sam_by_water.jpg></figure> </p><p>I should also highlight that we hit perfect weather over our 2 nights in Milford. Which is incredibly rare because the area is a rainforest and it rains over 200 days a year.</p><p>We took full advantage of the clear skies to complete Key Summit Hike, the alpine landscape was wonderful.</p><p><figure><img src=/img/May7-11/will_hike.jpg></figure> </p><p>I also want to call out that there are even bathrooms on hikes in NZ. Isn&rsquo;t that incredible?</p><p><figure><img src=/img/May7-11/bathroom_on_hike.jpg></figure> </p><p>Our time in Milford was wrapped up by a parent sponsored birthday dinner at the lodge. It was probably the best meal out we’ve had so far on our travels. The bottle of wine certainly didn’t hurt.</p><p><figure><img src=/img/May7-11/fancy_dinner.jpg></figure> </p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://swillasnomads.github.io./js/jquery.min.js></script>
