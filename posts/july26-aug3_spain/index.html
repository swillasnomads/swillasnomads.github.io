Some would say we had gotten too comfortable in Biarritz. A shake up was in order.</p><p><figure><img src=/img/July26-Aug3/malaga_hotel.jpg></figure> </p><h3 id=heading-south>Heading south</h3><p>We really wanted more heat. Constant days of over 30, with no chance of rain, so we headed to Málaga. And Spain delivered.</p><p>I’ll spare you the details of our long travel day to Málaga and just say that it involved 3 buses, a flight and 2 more buses 🚎 ✈️ 🚌 (our travel clothes desperately needed a wash after that day).</p><p><figure><img src=/img/July26-Aug3/malaga_travel_day.jpg></figure> </p><p>We were only in Málaga for one full day before we were to venture to San Pablo to visit Ingrid and Bruce (Will’s aunt and uncle).</p><p><figure><img src=/img/July26-Aug3/malaga_colours.jpg></figure> </p><p>We spent most of that time in the old city with a notable exception for lunch, where we ventured 30mins outside of the city to eat paella (the best rated restaurant Will could find that was open on a Wednesday) and drink cava in honour of Will’s birthday. We were far enough outside the tourist district that no one really spoke english in the restaurant, and so we’re unsure why at the end of our meal the waiter gave us both a free digestif but no complaints here - it was the cherry on top of a delicious meal.</p><p><figure><img src=/img/July26-Aug3/malaga_paella.jpg></figure> </p><p>We should have gone into a siesta after that lunch, but it was not to be. We had places to be, paintings to see.</p><p><figure><img src=/img/July26-Aug3/malaga_picasso.jpg></figure> </p><p>We walked around the old town, visited the Picasso museum, had yet another drink on a terrasse to cool down (and got another drink for free for unknown reasons) and had churros from Casa Aranda, established in 1932.</p><p><figure><img src=/img/July26-Aug3/malaga_drinks.jpg></figure> </p><p>This may be an ignorant thing to write, but churros aren’t meant to be sweet. Even the chocolate dipping sauce wasn’t sweet. Actually an overall observation from Europe so far is that desserts aren’t sickly sweet, that’s a North American thing…</p><p><figure><img src=/img/July26-Aug3/churros.jpeg></figure> </p><h3 id=el-diplomatico-feo-edf>El Diplomatico Feo (EDF)</h3><p>On July 28th, we traveled by bus to San Roque, roughly 3 hours west of Málaga, where we were picked up by Ingrid and driven 50 mins inland to San Pablo.</p><p><figure><img src=/img/July26-Aug3/map.jpg></figure> </p><p>Just outside of San Pablo, Ingrid and Bruce (ex-diplomats) have the most wonderful BnB in the Spanish countryside (not a fake airbnb, but a real bed and breakfast, where every morning a feast is laid out for their guests).</p><p><figure><img src=/img/July26-Aug3/all4.jpg></figure> </p><p>And though the weather continued to be punishing, Will and I had a wonderful time - how could we not? The property is stunning, dinner conversations with our hosts were always incredibly engaging, taking us well into the night and the hospitality Ingrid and Bruce showed two leeches such as ourselves was unparalleled and very generous.</p><p><figure><img src=/img/July26-Aug3/EDF_outside.jpg></figure> </p><p>A big thank you for welcoming us into your home and sharing your knowledge and stories from your remarkable lives, we’d love to come back one day (maybe in the spring this time 🥵).</p><p><figure><img src=/img/July26-Aug3/dinner.jpg></figure> </p><h3 id=highlights-from-the-south-of-spain>Highlights from the south of spain</h3><p><figure><img src=/img/July26-Aug3/ingrid_cave.jpg></figure> </p><h4 id=cueva-de-la-pileta--ronda>Cueva de la Pileta & Ronda</h4><p>On our first full day at EDF, Ingrid took us to the two places we most wanted to visit in the region. We had been told by multiple people that we had to visit the Cueva de la Pileta and Ronda.</p><p><figure><img src=/img/July26-Aug3/cave_outside.jpg></figure> </p><p>The caves were a trip highlight. In my opinion the best way to interact with history (so much better than a museum). The Pileta Cave system, discovered in 1905, spans multiple kilometers and is filled with art and artifacts of prehistoric humans. The caves are filled with smoke residue from multiple fires over millennia, humans from the neolithic period (10k-5k years ago) left calendars on the walls believed to track the lunar cycle and pieces of clay pottery. The earliest paintings were carbon dated to 40 thousand years ago (a relatively new discovery, the last time Ingrid had been to the caves the paintings were estimated to be ~30 thousand years old).</p><p><figure><img src=/img/July26-Aug3/cave_painting.jpg></figure> </p><p>Unfortunately, we were not allowed photography in the caves. I guess it means you’ll have to plan your own trip to la Cueva de la Pileta (or cheat by checking out the <a href=https://cuevadelapileta.es/page/visita/>website</a>)!</p><p><figure><img src=/img/July26-Aug3/bridge_will.jpg></figure> </p><p>Ronda, our second stop of the day, is a beautiful city known for its imposing bridge (Puente Nuevo) completed in 1793 and its bullfighting ring. We were mostly there to see the bridge. My favourite piece of trivia is that the small window above the main arch once served as a prison.</p><p><figure><img src=/img/July26-Aug3/bridge_selfie.jpg></figure> </p><h4 id=too-hot-to-move>Too hot to move</h4><p>For the remainder of our stay at EDF we mainly laid low and kept to the shade.</p><p><figure><img src=/img/July26-Aug3/will_inside.jpg></figure> </p><p>We made great use of the pool and of the nearby river, where the water is slightly more refreshing, and little fishies pick at your dead skin (can’t say I ever got used to the feeling).</p><p><figure><img src=/img/July26-Aug3/river_us.jpg></figure> </p><p>Ingrid and Bruce treated us to the most wonderful meals, for which we owe them a home cooked meal when they eventually come to Toronto.</p><p><div id=myCarousel class="carousel slide" data-ride=carousel><ol class=carousel-indicators><li data-target=#myCarousel data-slide-to=0 class=active></li><li data-target=#myCarousel data-slide-to=1></li><li data-target=#myCarousel data-slide-to=2></li><li data-target=#myCarousel data-slide-to=3></li><li data-target=#myCarousel data-slide-to=4></li><li data-target=#myCarousel data-slide-to=5></li></ol><div class=carousel-inner><div class="item active"><img src=/img/July26-Aug3/will_breakfast.jpg alt style=width:100%></div><div class=item><img src=/img/July26-Aug3/EDF_outside2.jpg alt style=width:100%></div><div class=item><img src=/img/July26-Aug3/will_ingrid_road.jpg alt style=width:100%></div><div class=item><img src=/img/July26-Aug3/aqua_de_valencia.jpg alt style=width:100%></div><div class=item><img src=/img/July26-Aug3/river.jpg alt style=width:100%></div><div class=item><img src=/img/July26-Aug3/selfie_3_road.jpg alt style=width:100%></div></div><a class="left carousel-control" href=#myCarousel data-slide=prev><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left"></span>

All their influences can be felt to this day, and nowhere is it more beautiful to witness than atop the castle (which is free to visit!).</p><p><figure><img src=/img/July26-Aug3/castle_will_ingrid.jpg></figure> </p><p>A massive thank you to Ingrid for being our historic guide through the city (and really the whole region). You satiated our curiosity and then some!</p><p><figure><img src=/img/July26-Aug3/castle_ingrid.jpg></figure> </p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://swillasnomads.github.io./js/jquery.min.js></script>
