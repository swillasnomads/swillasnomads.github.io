<h1>Jan 25-29: Rossland, BC & Vancouver </h1>
<h1 id=post-4-will-has-family-too>Post 4: Will has Family Too</h1>
<p>Over the next week we would complete our drive out to the coast, officially completing the westward drive, but beforehand we had another family stop to make in Rossland, BC, home of Red Mountain and Willâ€™s first cousin once removed Margie and her husband Robert.</p>
<h2 id=margie--roberts-hospitality>Margie & Robertâ€™s Hospitality</h2>
<p>We were absolutely spoiled in Rossland for 4 days. We owe Margie and Robert a huge thank you for housing us, feeding us, entertaining us with stories, showing us the mountain and the town. Even though conditions on the mountain, for our 2 days of skiing, werenâ€™t ideal, we stayed out for full days, receiving a localâ€™s guide of the mountain, from where to park, how to secretly traverse the mountain and which tree runs are best - thank you Robert!</p>

<p>Now unfortunately me for me, Will finally captured one of my falls on video and put it into a mini montage, and though Iâ€™m sure no one wants to see such a thing, here is the video:</p>

<p>Besides falling daily while skiing we really did have a blast exploring Red, getting to know Margie and Robert and playing a complex game of Mariposa late on Wednesday (thanks for being troopers, sorry Will won)&mldr;</p>

<p>I would be remiss if I didnâ€™t mention the abundance of delicious food Will and I consumed, the home made goods were unparalleled (bread, brownies, cookies, mousse, granola bars), we had to steal the recipe for Margieâ€™s delicious granola bars.</p>
<p>A picture of us eating our last bars in a long line at Whistler:

<h3 id=recommendations-for-rossland>Recommendations for Rossland:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rossland Beer Company</strong> - we had to check it out since Mat recommended it and we had a good time</li>
<li><strong>Hopperâ€™s Bakery</strong> - we always have to stop for fresh bread and beer wherever we go</li>
</ul>
<p>Â </p>
<h2 id=visiting-vancouver>Visiting Vancouver</h2>
<p>Our last stay with family before heading to Whistler on our own for two weeks was Willâ€™s aunt, Lydia, her husband Urs and their roommate Ben in Vancouver. We gave our skied out bodies a few days rest, I even participated in a 1 hour long, painful but satisfying, foam rolling class with Lydia on the Friday morning. In the afternoon we put on our small puffer jackets (cause it was 6 degrees!) and went out for a lovely walk to Granville island. Our evening wrapped up with a delectable buddha type bowl (for which we will also be stealing the recipe), a homemade apple crisp and a game of Quirkle (which Will also won&mldr;ðŸ™„). Thank you all for spoiling us so, looking forward to seeing you all in a week, when we return from Whistler!</p>

<h3 id=few-observations>Few Observations:</h3>
<ul>
<li>I knew Vancouver winters were mild, but I had never experienced just how mild they really were. I could not believe it, no snow on the ground, no need for winter boots or winter coats. I even saw someone playing basketball without a shirt on&mldr; it&rsquo;s late January!</li>
<li>There was a palpable difference in energy entering Vancouver after having spent the last 3 weeks in small towns. It was busy, loud and car break-ins were common. Gone were the strangers in Golden and Rossland that waved at us as if we were long time friends. Needless to say we brought in all our valuables into the house (not something we had been doing until reaching Vancouver).</li>
<li>Eating vegan is incredibly easy and delicious when veteran vegans are labouring over succulent meals for you!!</li>
</ul>
<h3 id=recommendations>Recommendations:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pizza Mia Gourmet</strong> - Will and I both left a review on google for this pizza, if youâ€™re ever in Vancouver you must visit this family run restaurant! They have incredible vegan and vegetarian options, and I would highly recommend the paneer masala pizza</li>
