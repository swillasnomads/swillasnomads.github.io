A tale of travel in 2022.</h2><p>I should have been writing this post from the comforts of a Montreal cafe. But alas, it was not meant to be.</p><p>On March 18th we set out to drive back across the US over 4 days, stop in to visit friends in Philadelphia, NYC and Vermont before crossing the border back to Canada on March 28th. The drive back itinerary was chosen by optimizing for roughly 7hrs driving days and cheap accommodations close to the highway. As you can imagine, that led us to some truly random towns along the i-70.</p><p>Our days mostly consisted of eating a sad ‚Äúcontinental‚Äù breakfast, stopping at a trader joe‚Äôs to pick up some really good microwave meals for dinner, stopping for gas (we stopped looking at the price), and listening to many podcasts.</p><p><figure><img src=/img/Mar18-31/microwave_dinner.jpg></figure>¬†</p><p>We stopped in:</p><ul><li><strong>York, Nebraska</strong> (funnily enough, the motel was run by a man from Brampton, ON, he was definitely surprised to find us there, and we were just as surprised to see him)</li><li><strong>Princeton, Illinois</strong> (not to be confused with the well
known Princeton, NJ)</li><li><strong>Ashland, Ohio</strong> (we did play mini golf on our drive out of Ashland which was a lot of fun!)</li></ul><p><figure><img src=/img/Mar18-31/motel_views.jpg></figure>¬†</p><h2 id=the-real-stops>The real stops</h2><h3 id=philadelphia-pennsylvania>Philadelphia, Pennsylvania</h3><p>Philly had not originally been on our itinerary, but my old manager Sami told us we had to stop by, that we would love Philly and that he had a place for us to crash! And so we spent a night with Sami, in Philly and he was right, it‚Äôs a beautiful city. The architecture is stunning, the history of the city for the US is obviously significant, and it has many a spot to go out. Thank you Sami (& Zoey) for hosting us and showing us around in such a short period of time, our legs were definitely sore the next day from all our walking.</p><p><figure><img src=/img/Mar18-31/will_zoey.jpg></figure>¬†</p><h4 id=recommendations>Recommendations:</h4><ul><li><strong>Sonny&rsquo;s Famous Steaks:</strong> Obligatory Philly Cheesesteak, apparently you‚Äôre supposed to have it with cheese whiz; I refused. The bread was good though, and I would recommend it with onions and hot sauce.</li><li><strong>The Franklin Fountain:</strong> Such delicious ice cream üç¶. If you‚Äôre ever in the area, it‚Äôs a must! Pistachio was especially good.</li><li><strong>Buffalo Billiards :</strong> The bartenders were incredibly nice and I won 2 out of 3 games of three-way billiards, which definitely put a rose tint on the bar.</li><li><strong>Good Dog Bar:</strong> Somewhat of a dive bar, good food and a really fun atmosphere.</li><li><strong>Rittenhouse Square:</strong> A really pretty, european-esk park that reminded both Will and I of Square St-Louis in Montr√©al.</li><li><strong>All the historical buildings:</strong> Walking around liberty bell area is worth it.</li></ul><p><figure><img src=/img/Mar18-31/philly.jpg></figure>¬†</p><h3 id=next-up-new-york-city>Next up: New York City</h3><p>Now obviously, we couldn‚Äôt actually afford to stay in NYC but we were a short path ride away in Jersey City for our 2 nights in the city. We were able to visit with friends, tour central park, eat some delicious pizza and even some very respectable free hotdogs at a dive bar. We attended a comedy show at the comedy cellar and attempted to visit the Met, but they‚Äôre closed on Wednesdays. We visited the bull, but did not wait in line to take a picture. We found an adorable italian cafe and spent many hours there playing cards on a cold rainy day. We even witnessed a man stealing a bicycle with a hand-held saw, Will called the cops and unsurpringsly, nothing came of it. New York is insane.</p><p><h4></h4><div id=myCarousel class="carousel slide" data-ride=carousel><ol class=carousel-indicators><li data-target=#myCarousel data-slide-to=0 class=active></li><li data-target=#myCarousel data-slide-to=1></li><li data-target=#myCarousel data-slide-to=2></li><li data-target=#myCarousel data-slide-to=3></li><li data-target=#myCarousel data-slide-to=4></li><li data-target=#myCarousel data-slide-to=5></li><li data-target=#myCarousel data-slide-to=6></li></ol><div class=carousel-inner><div class="item active"><img src=/img/Mar18-31/sam_will_park.jpg alt style=width:100%></div><div class=item><img src=/img/Mar18-31/bull.jpg alt style=width:100%></div><div class=item><img src=/img/Mar18-31/sam_nikita.jpg alt style=width:100%></div><div class=item><img src=/img/Mar18-31/will_nikita.jpg alt style=width:100%></div><div class=item><img src=/img/Mar18-31/will_nikita_park.jpg alt style=width:100%></div><div class=item><img src=/img/Mar18-31/sam_subway.jpg alt style=width:100%></div><div class=item><img src=/img/Mar18-31/food_room.jpg alt style=width:100%></div></div><a class="left carousel-control" href=#myCarousel data-slide=prev><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left"></span>

The Grill in the name refers to the free hot dogs that come with any drink you order, and you can get a $3 pint. Will and Nikita were both able to eat 3 hotdogs and drink three pints for $9 each! I had to stop at 2.</li></ul><p><figure><img src=/img/Mar18-31/rudys.jpg></figure>¬†</p><ul><li><strong>Cafe Reggio:</strong> The atmosphere was so great we went twice. The servers were incredibly friendly, the espresso with bailey‚Äôs delicious and the food was fresh and tasty.</li></ul><p><figure><img src=/img/Mar18-31/will_cards.jpg></figure>¬†</p><ul><li><strong>Comedy Cellar:</strong> Thanks Nikita for recommending we do a show, even though we reserved too late to get an earlier showing, the 10h30pm show was hilarious and definitely a highlight of our stay in NYC.</li><li><strong>Citizens of Chelsea:</strong> A delicious aesthetically pleasing brunch or lunch spot, I‚Äôm really happy Claire brought me here on her lunch break!</li></ul><h3 id=skiing-in-vermont>Skiing in Vermont?</h3><h4 id=the-plan>The plan:</h4><p>Ski 3 more days in Vermont, which would have brought our total days on snow to 40. The plan was to ski Okemo on the 25th, Killington on the 26th (with friends) and Stowe on the 27th, before driving to Montr√©al to crash with Emika and Yannis on the 27th at night.</p><h4 id=what-happened>What happened?</h4><p>We did go to Okemo on the 25th, we showed up at noon, did exactly 2.5 runs and left. There were puddles at the bottom of the hill that covered your skis. The sport we were engaging in was really a cross between water skiing and alpine skiing. Thank goodness we didn‚Äôt have to pay out of pocket for the day.</p><p><figure><img src=/img/Mar18-31/okemo.jpg></figure>¬†</p><p>That night we were being joined by our close friend Jordan, his partner Chelsea and their 2 friends Isaac and Anna. We were meant to ski Killington the next day. However, after my Okemo experience on the Friday, I was not so sure I would be participating in any more water skiing.</p><p>Ultimately the decision was out of our hands. Will got to the airbnb on Friday afternoon and had a worsening tickle in his throat. We all know where this is going.</p><p>He took a covid test and it came back negative. We still warned the group of his symptoms, cause that‚Äôs the day and age we live in. We spent a few hours with all our friends on the Friday night, went to bed, and I woke up to a burning hot Will (temperature wise, friends), with goose bumps all over his body. He gets up, tests again and this time it does come back positive. We both quickly go back into our room, tell the housemates and head into research mode.</p><p><figure><img src=/img/Mar18-31/covid_room.jpg></figure>¬†</p><ul><li>Is there an airbnb nearby where we can isolate?</li><li>How long do we have to isolate for?</li><li>What are the US guidelines? What are the Canadian guidelines?</li><li>How do we extend our medical insurance?</li><li>How long does it take for symptoms to appear? (I didn‚Äôt have any, yet)</li></ul><p>In the end, our friends were incredibly nice and allowed us to stay the night in the current airbnb. Chelsea made a run to CSV to get us covid supplies: N95 masks (which the government is giving away for free), tylenol, gloves and hand sanitizer. We watched a lot of tv that day.</p><p><figure><img src=/img/Mar18-31/lunch_mask.jpg></figure>¬†</p><p>Both the US and Canada require a minimum of 5 days of isolation from the time of first symptoms, which meant we needed to stay in the states until at least the 30th. At which point, if either of us tested positive we wouldn‚Äôt be able to cross the border. Fast forward to the 30th, Will is still feeling sick, though better. I feel as though I have a mild cold but am not yet testing positive. We have extended our airbnb stay until April 1st (when the Canadian government no longer requires testing to cross the border).</p><p><figure><img src=/img/Mar18-31/will_covid.jpg></figure>¬†</p><p>The biggest impediment this poses to our travels is whether or not we will both be feeling better by our flights to Australia (booked for April 7th). We‚Äôre really worried I will catch or increase my viral load, so the two of us are sleeping in separate rooms, wearing masks in the house and hoping we both have a speedy recovery.</p><p>The silver lining here is that we‚Äôre being forced to slow down. We‚Äôre catching up on blog posts and videos, reading, going on walks, watching tv and sleeping long hours (probably cause we‚Äôre both fighting a virus but still).</p><p><figure><img src=/img/Mar18-31/will_wave.jpg></figure>¬†</p><p>Hopefully our next post will be of Australia, until then, we send our love from Tupper Lake, NY.</p><p><figure><img src=/img/Mar18-31/zoom_in_will.jpg></figure>¬†</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://swillasnomads.github.io./js/jquery.min.js></script>
