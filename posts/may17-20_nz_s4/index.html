Our initial plan was to drive all the way around the island, going through Nelson, down the east coast and back to Christchurch. [<a href=https://www.traveledmap.com/traveledmap/3sBBHdVayuZDfudHzRgnv9i39Bu2#>Plug for my interactive map!</a>]</p><p><figure><img src=/img/May17-20/map.jpg></figure> </p><p>But given we had spent an extra day in Queenstown and we were trying to learn from past overplanning mistakes, we decided we would cut across Arthur&rsquo;s Pass to head back across the island and keep a slower pace. We would spend our last two nights in Akaroa (a town with a French Colonial history).</p><p><figure><img src=/img/May17-20/Akaroa.jpg></figure> </p><h3 id=punakaiki-pancake-rocks>Punakaiki Pancake Rocks</h3><p><figure><img src=/img/May17-20/punakaiki_rocks.jpg></figure> </p><p>Having said that, I was really looking forward to seeing a specific rock formation in Punakaiki, a 2 hour detour from our turn off onto Arthur’s pass, so I lobbied Will and we drove to the rocks.</p><p><figure><img src=/img/May17-20/sam_punakaiki.jpg></figure> </p><p>I don’t know if the magic of the rocks come across in our pictures, but it was definitely fascinating to see in person, and I’m happy we took the detour.</p><p><figure><img src=/img/May17-20/will_walking_punakaiki.jpg></figure> </p><p>Even though we timmed the tides poorly again and missed the blow hole action.</p><p><figure><img src=/img/May17-20/punakaiki_pools.jpg></figure> </p><h3 id=jacksons-retreat-alpine-holiday-park>Jackson’s Retreat Alpine Holiday Park</h3><p><figure><img src=/img/May17-20/sam_rainforest.jpg></figure> </p><p>This Holiday Park gave us access to a small walk up to a waterfall on the premises and a few different places to encounter glow worms at night. Not to mention a covered bbq, which allowed us to have one of our best meals without getting rained on.</p><p><figure><img src=/img/May17-20/waterfall.jpg></figure> </p><p>We were 2 of 3 people staying at this Holiday Park that night, and low and behold the other was a fellow Canadian named Kate from Nova Scotia. We started chatting over dinner and pretty much spent our evening with her, swapping stories, playing partial jenga and going to see the glow worms.</p><p>She’s the one who advised us that if we liked Punakaiki we had to check out Castle Hill on our drive out the next day.</p><h3 id=castle-hill>Castle Hill</h3><p><figure><img src=/img/May17-20/will_castle_hill.jpg></figure> </p><p>We’re glad we got the recommendation, the walk was a perfect spot to stretch our legs and admire another one of New Zealand’s alluring landscapes.</p><p><figure><img src=/img/May17-20/castle_hill_selfie.jpg></figure> </p><h3 id=akaroa>Akaroa</h3><p>Once we had made it to Akaroa, we congratulated ourselves with a drink along the harbour, to take advantage of the sun and rest before our last full campervaning day.</p><p><figure><img src=/img/May17-20/drinks.jpg></figure> </p><p>Will had found one last hike for us to complete on our last day. The hike gave us beautiful views of the peninsula, changing landscapes and incredibly variable winds. Thankfully, this hike was rated moderate and though there was a climb, it didn’t take up 6 hours of our day.</p><p><figure><img src=/img/May17-20/selfie_hike.jpg></figure> </p><p>We were able to head into town for lunch, and settle in for a very relaxing afternoon.</p><p><div id=myCarousel class="carousel slide" data-ride=carousel><ol class=carousel-indicators><li data-target=#myCarousel data-slide-to=0 class=active></li><li data-target=#myCarousel data-slide-to=1></li><li data-target=#myCarousel data-slide-to=2></li><li data-target=#myCarousel data-slide-to=3></li><li data-target=#myCarousel data-slide-to=4></li><li data-target=#myCarousel data-slide-to=5></li><li data-target=#myCarousel data-slide-to=6></li><li data-target=#myCarousel data-slide-to=7></li></ol><div class=carousel-inner><div class="item active"><img src=/img/May17-20/will_hike_annoyed.jpg alt style=width:100%></div><div class=item><img src=/img/May17-20/salade_lunch.jpg alt style=width:100%></div><div class=item><img src=/img/May17-20/Akaroa_harbour.jpg alt style=width:100%></div><div class=item><img src=/img/May17-20/bar_crib.jpg alt style=width:100%></div><div class=item><img src=/img/May17-20/sam_walking.jpg alt style=width:100%></div><div class=item><img src=/img/May17-20/lonely_boat.jpg alt style=width:100%></div><div class=item><img src=/img/May17-20/seaguls.jpg alt style=width:100%></div><div class=item><img src=/img/May17-20/breaky.jpg alt style=width:100%></div></div><a class="left carousel-control" href=#myCarousel data-slide=prev><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left"></span>

The central location was great, but the distance of the washrooms was not ideal. That little detail aside, we had a lovely time, cooked up a random couscous meal to finish up all our food and enjoy a gorgeous sunset by the water.</p><p><figure><img src=/img/May17-20/sunset_dinner.jpg></figure> </p><p>My recommendation to others would be to do your last night in a Holiday Park so you can properly empty your grey water tank and wash all your dishes in a kitchen sink, but you live and you learn.</p><p><figure><img src=/img/May17-20/making_dinner.jpg></figure> </p><p>The next morning in the misting rain, we put away the bed in the back of the van and enjoyed our breakfast sitting at the table in the van for the first time in 17 days.</p><p><figure><img src=/img/May17-20/will_van_table.jpg></figure> </p><h3 id=stint-in-christchurch>Stint in Christchurch</h3><p>We had some time to kill before returning the van and so decided to spend it in Christchurch. We obviously toured the botanical gardens and picked up lunch at the downtown Riverside Market (would recommend).</p><p><figure><img src=/img/May17-20/gardens.jpg></figure> </p><p>I was weirdly really sad to say goodbye to the van. I really enjoyed having my whole life on a set of wheels. It made eating cheaply really easy, given we had a fridge in the van. We could take naps whenever, and we never had to think about what to bring with us, since it was all in the van. That doesn’t mean I wasn’t excited to have an attached bathroom in our motel room that night. Such a luxury not to have to go outside to pee in the middle of the night.</p><p><figure><img src=/img/May17-20/sam_breaky_van.jpg></figure> </p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://swillasnomads.github.io./js/jquery.min.js></script>
