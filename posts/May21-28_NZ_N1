## Post 20: Entering Midle Earth

{{< figure src="/img/May21-28/shire.jpg" >}} 
&nbsp;

Our campervan was swapped out for a small toyota hybrid, which was really nice given the price of gas (hovering around 3NZD/L). Fun fact, New Zealand base gas is at 91 octane, and it can go as high as 100 in some places (warned that it‚Äôs not good for all cars, lol. 

We drove straight from Auckland to Matamata, settled into a little garage airbnb, that was very cute, but the bathroom was in another shed, so we had to yet again go outside in the middle of the night to use the bathroom‚Ä¶ 

We settled ourselves in on the 22nd, not doing much of note other than seeing a rainbow.

&nbsp;

But the magic was to happen the next day.  

### Hobbiton 

{{< figure src="/img/May21-28/sam_wise_house.jpg" >}} 
&nbsp;

Worth every penny. Assuming you‚Äôre a Lord of the Rings fan of course. Which we are. 

{{< figure src="/img/May21-28/sam_will_hobbit.jpg" >}} 
&nbsp;

We were able to tour the set of the Shire. As our official brochure described: 

> In March 1999 the crew began the nine month quest to bring the ideas for Hobbiton to fruition; help was provided by the New Zealand Army, and soon 39 temporary Hobbit Holes‚Ñ¢ were scattered across the 12 acre plot used for the set. 

{{< figure src="/img/May21-28/sam_hobbit.jpg" >}} 
&nbsp;

{{< figure src="/img/May21-28/hobbit_house_blue.jpg" >}} 
&nbsp;

This set which was painstakingly built was then torn down and the land returned to be grazed by the sheep before being rebuilt more permanently in 2009 for the Hobbit Trilogy. The new set is meticulously maintained to this day for tourists' enjoyment. 

{{< figure src="/img/May21-28/will_hobit.jpg" >}} 
&nbsp;

We were told that during pre covid times there were tour buses leaving every 5 minutes for the set, with ~45 people per bus. The crowds must have been insane. We however did not feel crowded on our tour, adding to the splendor. 

{{< figure src="/img/May21-28/frodo_house.jpg" >}} 
&nbsp;

Even though our lunch was anything but splendor.

&nbsp;

### Rotorua Hot Springs 

Rotorua was next. An area known for its geothermal activity. I was pretty keen on soaking in one of their natural hot spring, however doing it on the cheap was a far cry from our beautiful relaxing evening spent at Onsen Hot Pools. 

We first checked out the free foot bath in one of Rotorua‚Äôs main parks within the city, which was actually quite nice, once you got over the overwhelming sulfur smell (rotten eggs that makes your stomach turn). Honestly, depending how the wind was blowing I could barely breathe. 

{{< figure src="/img/May21-28/feet_bath.jpg" >}} 
&nbsp;

And we culminated our day in a free hot spring 40min outside of Rotorua, where we were greeted by multiple signs telling us not to leave valuables in the car (thankfully, ALL our valuables were in the car). We crossed our fingers and hoped for the best. We scouted out the creek at first to see where we‚Äôd be entering. 

We then went back to the car to put on our bathing suits, made our way to the water, and got it. The water was indeed incredibly warm, it was lovely. 

{{< figure src="/img/May21-28/hot_spring.jpg" >}} 
&nbsp;

Getting out was the unpleasant part. We were immediately welcomed by a muddy river bank, and very cold fall air. We had to then walk back to the car, dry ourselves off, put on clothes and get back in the car. It‚Äôs at this point that I realized the small that covered by whole body. That lovely sulfur smell was now on my skin and bathing suit. 

Definitely an experience we‚Äôll remember üòÇ. 

I was so set on showering when we got to our accommodations that night, but the place was so weird, I didn‚Äôt. Our weird hostel with an equally weird host had no hot water running in the women‚Äôs bathroom, and the family washroom with the hot water didn‚Äôt drain so there was water all over the floor. I decided I would smell like eggs and shower after our biggest hike yet scheduled for the next day. 

### The Tongariro Crossing

Often touted as one of the greatest day hikes in New Zealand and even possibly the world, it takes you through 20kms of varying terrain and right by Mount Doom (you know, the place where Frodo drops the ring). 

{{< figure src="/img/May21-28/sign.jpg" >}} 
&nbsp;

The hike however is not a loop or a there and back trail. You leave your car at the end and get a shuttle to the beginning. The shuttle costs like $40nzd per person and so our host suggested we ask this other guest at the hostel, Marcus, for a ride the next day since he was heading in that direction and might be willing to act as our shuttle for a little bit of gas money. 

{{< figure src="/img/May21-28/will_start_hike.jpg" >}} 
&nbsp;

Marcus is an incredibly kind man from Switzerland, who agreed to leave with us in the morning. We knew the trail could get incredibly cold, so we were prepared with all our warm layers, rain pants, tuques and gloves. 

{{< figure src="/img/May21-28/sam_crossing_happy.jpg" >}} 
&nbsp;

It was quite an adventure even just finding the parking lot after google maps let us astray (technology tried to kill us that day - it was a sign), but once we found it, we parked our car (it was the only one), got in Marcus‚Äô car and drove to the start. That‚Äôs where we saw the actual warning signs telling us not to complete the hike. 

{{< figure src="/img/May21-28/dont_go.jpg" >}} 
&nbsp;

But we figured, how hard can it really be, and we kinda have to get back to our car. 

So we set out. On what would be as harrowing an adventure as what Frodo and Sam encountered, I assume. We were the only ones who completed the hike that day and for good reason. Some did the halfway point and warned us that the winds were so strong they had knocked over a 230lbs man. 


{{< figure src="/img/May21-28/sam_crossing_end.jpg" >}} 
&nbsp;

> We have no photos of the most harrowing period of the hike. It was freezing cold, the winds were trying to knock us down and the last thing we were thinking about was reaching for our phones. 

With wind getting progressively stronger as we ascended we took cover behind a boulder to quickly shovel our lunch in our mouth before continuing on, bent sideways into the wind to avoid being blown over. At multiple points we considered turning back, our adrenaline was pumping and it was difficult not to be fearful for our safety. 

Through sheer will, we got to the summit of the hike, the winds and clouds were so heavy we couldn‚Äôt and didn‚Äôt stop to read the info card and kept going over the hump to hide behind some more rocks. 

{{< figure src="/img/May21-28/sam_blue_pools.jpg" >}} 
&nbsp;

At this point I think we both knew the worst was behind us and we just had to enjoy the views we were getting and finish the hike. 

{{< figure src="/img/May21-28/will_blue_pools.jpg" >}} 
&nbsp;

We completed the journey in just over 6hours. 

{{< figure src="/img/May21-28/crossing_selfie.jpg" >}} 
&nbsp;

Wouldn‚Äôt recommend doing the hike under such conditions. The irony is that we wouldn‚Äôt have been able to do it without Marcus since I don‚Äôt think the shuttles run when the hike isn‚Äôt advised. 

But cheers to crazy life experiences üçª. 

### Tongariro National Park - Gollum‚Äôs Pool 

{{< figure src="/img/May21-28/will_gollum.jpg" >}} 
&nbsp;

We spend a bit more time driving around the park, hoping to get a glimpse of Mount Doom, since the clouds the previous day hadn‚Äôt allowed us to see it. 

And just as we were completing our mini walk to Gollum‚Äôs Pool, and heading back for lunch we glimpsed the volcano in all its glory. 

{{< figure src="/img/May21-28/mount_doom.jpg" >}} 
&nbsp;

The Pool was also incredibly beautiful. A wonderful way to wrap up our time in the National Park. 

{{< figure src="/img/May21-28/sam_pool.jpg" >}} 
&nbsp;

### Glow Worm Caves

{{< figure src="/img/May21-28/cave_view.jpg" >}} 
&nbsp;

Will and I both wanted to see some more glow worms and Waitomo is the place to do it. I voted for a boat tour through the caves, but due to a sale, Will convinced me to go rafting. In the fall. 

{{< figure src="/img/May21-28/cave_start.jpg" >}} 
&nbsp;

I‚Äôll say this, I‚Äôm glad I did it, but I won‚Äôt be doing it again. At least not in the fall. The air temperature was 12 degrees, and the water 10 degrees. Even with incredibly thick wet suits, my hands could not take the cold. They went seriously numb (took until the next day for them to thaw). 

{{< figure src="/img/May21-28/cave_cold.jpg" >}} 
&nbsp;

But we were walking through beautiful caves, floating through some sections of water, jumping backwards off small waterfalls and floating lights off in a glow worm cave (definitely the highlight, it‚Äôs like floating in space). 

{{< figure src="/img/May21-28/will_water.jpg" >}} 
&nbsp;

### Hamilton Gardens / Stay with Lee & Neville 

On our way to stay with our most gracious hosts yet, we stopped at Hamilton Gardens, which had come recommend by many people on the rafting tour. 

It has multiple enclosed gardens with different themes. 

From Tudor, to Egyptian, to Japanese and everything in between, we had a blast touring them all. 

{{< carousel title="" >}}
&nbsp;

We pulled into Neville and Lee‚Äôs place around 6pm. Neville and Lee are a wonderful couple we met at the holiday park in Akaroa who opened up their home for us while we were in Auckland. They were such incredibly gracious hosts, Lee cooked us up a storm: roast lamb, homemade gravy, roasted kumara and potatoes with greens on the side. Not to mention apple crumble for dessert. We had the pleasure of getting to know them over our one night at their place and subsequently had our best night sleep yet. 

{{< figure src="/img/May21-28/lee_neville.jpg" >}} 
&nbsp;

### Auckland & Flights to France 

{{< figure src="/img/May21-28/will_auckland.jpg" >}} 
&nbsp;

We wrapped up New Zealand with a morning spent in Auckland, climbing up Mount Eden to get views of the city from above, eating some delicious sushi for lunch and resting in a lovely cafe before heading to the airport and hoping we yet again had all our paperwork. 

{{< figure src="/img/May21-28/auckland_view.jpg" >}} 
&nbsp;

Our travel day was a long one. A 12hour flight, followed by another 10hour flight. We arrived in Paris a little out of it to say the least, ahaha. 

{{< figure src="/img/May21-28/auckland_cafe.jpg" >}}
