Nestled in a large food court in Malaga airport. We couldn’t believe our eyes. (Though we didn’t order anything).</p><p><figure><img src=/img/Aug4-11/tim_hortons.jpg></figure> </p><h3 id=porto-aug-4---8>Porto (Aug 4 - 8)</h3><p><div id=myCarousel class="carousel slide" data-ride=carousel><ol class=carousel-indicators><li data-target=#myCarousel data-slide-to=0 class=active></li><li data-target=#myCarousel data-slide-to=1></li><li data-target=#myCarousel data-slide-to=2></li><li data-target=#myCarousel data-slide-to=3></li><li data-target=#myCarousel data-slide-to=4></li><li data-target=#myCarousel data-slide-to=5></li></ol><div class=carousel-inner><div class="item active"><img src=/img/Aug4-11/porto_bridge_selfie.jpg alt style=width:100%></div><div class=item><img src=/img/Aug4-11/porto_airbnb.jpg alt style=width:100%></div><div class=item><img src=/img/Aug4-11/porto_colours.jpg alt style=width:100%></div><div class=item><img src=/img/Aug4-11/porto_monastery.jpg alt style=width:100%></div><div class=item><img src=/img/Aug4-11/porto_sam_botanical.jpg alt style=width:100%></div><div class=item><img src=/img/Aug4-11/porto_sunset.jpg alt style=width:100%></div></div><a class="left carousel-control" href=#myCarousel data-slide=prev><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left"></span>

Villa Nova de Gaia is the city on the other side of the Douro river. Technically a part of the Porto District, it is home to all the Port cellars (established outside city limits to avoid paying large taxes). We were walking distance to the most beautiful park overlooking the city of Porto (we spent many a nights at the park and/or corresponding bar).</p><p><figure><img src=/img/Aug4-11/porto_fave_park_pizza.jpg></figure> </p><h4 id=porto-highlights>Porto Highlights</h4><ul><li>Clérigos Tower, offering 360 views of the city</li></ul><p><figure><img src=/img/Aug4-11/porto_tower.jpg></figure> </p><p><figure><img src=/img/Aug4-11/porto_tower_view.jpg></figure> </p><ul><li>After spending 4 days in Porto, we had found our favourite bars (Mira Jazz - the hidden one, Café El Reys - the cheap one and Terrace Cable Car - the one with a view)</li></ul><p><figure><img src=/img/Aug4-11/porto_will_beer_bar.jpg></figure> </p><p><figure><img src=/img/Aug4-11/porto_cheap_bar.jpg></figure> </p><ul><li>Port tasting at Taylor’s. The tasting includes an audio tour of the cellar turned museum which teaches you all there is to know about Port. Funnest fact I took away was that the english wanted to make wine in Portugal in the 17th century to bring down the cost of it, but the wine being shipped all the way to England turned sour, thus they added alcohol to help perserve it (i.e. fortify it). Port making was thus born along the Douro river.</li></ul><p><figure><img src=/img/Aug4-11/porto_port.jpg></figure> </p><ul><li>50 min boat tour of all 6 Porto bridges. It’s always nice to get out onto the water and see things from a different vantage point. We’d recommend. And actually, what we wish we would have done is a train ride up to the Douro Valley and a boat trip back down - something for next time.</li></ul><h4 id=porto-surprises>Porto Surprises</h4><ul><li>We had hoped to surf again in Porto, so we made our way out to one of their beaches by bus. The weather wasn’t really nice that day which didn’t help but the beach was dissapointing, very industrial, no great infrastrucure and honestly quite hard to get to (without a car). We just ended up missing Biarritz.</li></ul><p><figure><img src=/img/Aug4-11/porto_beach.jpg></figure> </p><ul><li>Arriving in Portugal Will was eager to try all the food. I was excited to taste portugese chicken in portugal. But turns out, that is near impossible to find, it’s not really a thing like Nando’s made us think. However, what Porto does offer up in spades is the Francesinha. A weird meat sandwich, doused in gravy, and covered with melted cheese and an egg. A heart attack on a plate. To satiates Will’s curiousity we went out to a local’s recommendation for the sandwhiches and had them for dinner. It was definitely a one and done for me, but Will really did enjoy it.</li></ul><p><figure><img src=/img/Aug4-11/porto_weird_sandy.jpg></figure> </p><ul><li>If we thought we were going to be escaping the high salt content across the border from Spain, we were wrong. We found food in Portugal to also be very salted, especially the fish.</li><li>The last thing that took us by surprise were the ruins. Buildings in and around the downtown core completely abandoned. Some of which had been left alone for so long they had trees growing through them. Not sure if it’s due to difficult building regulations or lack of investment, but they were certainly everywhere.</li></ul><p><figure><img src=/img/Aug4-11/porto_ruins_boat.jpg></figure> </p><p><figure><img src=/img/Aug4-11/porto_ruins_hole.jpg></figure> </p><p><figure><img src=/img/Aug4-11/porto_ruins_street.jpg></figure> </p><h3 id=lisbon-aug-9-11>Lisbon (Aug 9-11)</h3><p>Our two days in Lisbon were split between exploring the city and visiting nearby Sintra. The fact that the city shares a name with the city in one of our favourite shows (The Witcher), might have played into our decision to go.</p><p><figure><img src=/img/Aug4-11/lisbon_will.jpg></figure> </p><h4 id=lisbon>Lisbon</h4><p>We jammed packed our limited time in Lisbon with all the must sees. The city castle (Castelo de S. Jorge), the main view points, commerce square, timeout market, Blenheim, Carmo Covent, and LX factory.</p><p><figure><img src=/img/Aug4-11/lisbon_cards.jpg></figure> </p><p>We were impressed by the castle, though it was filled with tourists it didn’t feel too busy inside. The grounds were very large offering beautiful views of the city and also a peaceful place to set up with a book and read. (And of course it was also rich in history - first fortification on the site started in the 1st century BC).</p><p><figure><img src=/img/Aug4-11/lisbon_castle_selfie.jpg></figure> </p><p><figure><img src=/img/Aug4-11/lisbon_castle.jpg></figure> </p><p>Our favourite site we paid to visit was the Carmo Covent. An old monastery first founded in 1389, remodeled through the ages before succumbing to the earthquake of 1755. A large church without a roof is quite beautiful and bright on a nice sunny day.</p><p><figure><img src=/img/Aug4-11/lisbon_ruins.jpg></figure> </p><p><figure><img src=/img/Aug4-11/lisbon_ruins_outside.jpg></figure> </p><p>Will’s favourite stop on our Lisbon journey was the LX Factory, a historical industrial complexe turned office, restaurant, galery and bar scene.</p><p><figure><img src=/img/Aug4-11/lisbon_books.jpg></figure> </p><p>It was a lovely area to spend a few hours, get a drink, view some art and grab some food. It’s where we finally found some portuguese chicken!</p><p><figure><img src=/img/Aug4-11/lisbon_factory_cards.jpg></figure> </p><h4 id=sintra>Sintra</h4><p><figure><img src=/img/Aug4-11/sintra_view.jpg></figure> </p><p>Sintra is a whimsical city, full of eclectic architecture and, of course, old ruins.</p><p><figure><img src=/img/Aug4-11/sintra_romance.jpg></figure> </p><p>We toured the Quinta de Regaleira, a 16th century property filled with for lack of a better word, random structures. We went in with the idea of romantic structures and quiet forest walks, but were instead greeted by hundreds of tourists and long lines. I’m not sure we would do it again. Perhaps if you went first thing in the morning.</p><p><figure><img src=/img/Aug4-11/sintra_taro.jpg></figure> </p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://swillasnomads.github.io./js/jquery.min.js></script>
