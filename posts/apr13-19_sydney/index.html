Here are the bullet points to our sob story:</p><ul><li>We were scheduled to leave for Melbourne on Thursday april 7th.</li><li>Given we had both caught covid in the states we each needed a doctor&rsquo;s note clearing us for travel, which were a small headache to obtain.</li><li>We get to the airport to realize that, duh, we need a visa to enter Australia, but no worries it should only take 10min to obtain.</li><li>We file for the visa and pay extra for a half hour turn around.</li><li>Long story short, the visas don’t show up until well after the counter has closed, and we miss our flights.</li><li>Through some small miracle Will is able to rebook us onto a flight to Sydney leaving on the 11th and arriving on the 13th.</li><li>We fly out on the 11th to Vancouver, have an 8hrs layover before our 15hr flight to Sydney.</li><li>Once in Vancouver, we’re told by another passenger that the Quantas flight to Sydney has been delayed by 13hrs. I.e. instead of leaving at 10pm on the 11th (for a red eye flight), it would be leaving on the 12th at 11am.</li><li>We’re on the phone with Quantas for 2hours with no luck.
Quantas has no agents working at the airport in Vancouver (since we’re there 8hrs before the supposed departure of our flight).</li><li>Our bags are lost somewhere in the back of the airport, since they were checked to go directly to Sydney.</li><li>Fast forward, we’re told to come back 3hrs before our flight to talk to a Quantas agent at the desk, if only to retrieve our luggage for the night. So, we head into Vancouver to see Will’s aunt, Lydia.</li><li>We go back to the airport around 8h30pm and we find agents - yay!</li><li>We’re trying to explain to them that we want our luggage back, when the agent asks if we want to be put on the Air Canada 10h30pm flight to Sydney. She caveats that we won’t be sitting together, but at this point we’ll travel with the luggage if it means arriving in Australia.</li><li>We retrieve our bags, re-check them with Air Canada and are finallyyyyy on our way down unda.</li><li>The stress of the whole thing most definitely took some years off our lives.</li></ul><h3 id=sydney>Sydney</h3><p><figure><img src=/img/Apr13-19/s_w_opera.jpg></figure> </p><p>We were incredibly fortunate to stay with my oldest friend Valerie, and her partner Johnny in Sydney. Val moved to Sydney two weeks prior to us arriving and so though she played tourguide, she had to keep reminding us she couldn’t answer all our questions 😅.</p><p><figure><img src=/img/Apr13-19/hyde_park.jpg></figure> </p><p>Our first day in Sydney. we went on an epic walking adventure, we toured the lively neighbourhood of Surry hills, walked through Hyde Park, saw Saint Marie’s Cathedral, the botanical gardens and the famous Sydney Opera House. The day was capped off with a delicious dinner on a rooftop patio overlooking the city.</p><p><figure><img src=/img/Apr13-19/sam_opera.jpg></figure> </p><p>Val and Johnny left us their apartment when they left for an Easter weekend to the Blue Mountains, and we can not thank them enough. The apartment is beautiful and with public transportation free for Easter weekend, Will and I made the most of it to tour the city.</p><p><figure><img src=/img/Apr13-19/b_c_walk.jpg></figure> </p><p>We visited Manly Beach and Cockatoo Island by ferry (for free!!)<figure><img src=/img/Apr13-19/manly_beach.jpg></figure> </p><p><figure><img src=/img/Apr13-19/cockatoo_island.jpg></figure> </p><p>We used the free buses to bring us to the Sydney Fish Market, where we indulged ourselves with a platter of grilled seafood and a bottle of Cuvée.</p><p><figure><img src=/img/Apr13-19/fish_market.jpg></figure> </p><p>And we completed the mandatory Bondi to Coogee walk, a stunning coastal walk, through multiple of Sydney’s beaches. Had it been a bit warmer we might have gone swimming.</p><p><figure><img src=/img/Apr13-19/bondi_beach.jpg></figure> </p><p>And on Val’s Birthday, April 17th, we took the train (also free), 2 hours north to the Blue Mountains to spend the day with her exploring the beautiful scenery.</p><p><h4></h4><div id=myCarousel class="carousel slide" data-ride=carousel><ol class=carousel-indicators><li data-target=#myCarousel data-slide-to=0 class=active></li><li data-target=#myCarousel data-slide-to=1></li><li data-target=#myCarousel data-slide-to=2></li><li data-target=#myCarousel data-slide-to=3></li><li data-target=#myCarousel data-slide-to=4></li><li data-target=#myCarousel data-slide-to=5></li></ol><div class=carousel-inner><div class="item active"><img src=/img/Apr13-19/blue_mountain_val_sam.jpg alt style=width:100%></div><div class=item><img src=/img/Apr13-19/blue_mountains_will.jpg alt style=width:100%></div><div class=item><img src=/img/Apr13-19/sam_blue_mountains.jpg alt style=width:100%></div><div class=item><img src=/img/Apr13-19/group.jpg alt style=width:100%></div><div class=item><img src=/img/Apr13-19/blue_mountain_will2.jpg alt style=width:100%></div><div class=item><img src=/img/Apr13-19/train_station.jpg alt style=width:100%></div></div><a class="left carousel-control" href=#myCarousel data-slide=prev><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left"></span>

The succulents in the botanical garden were all on steroids. Not to mention the terrifying bin chickens (Australian white ibis), that come way too close to you.<figure><img src=/img/Apr13-19/large_trees.jpg></figure> </li><li>You don’t get used to drivers on the wrong side of the road.<figure><img src=/img/Apr13-19/wrong_side.jpg></figure> </li><li>There is no advertising on public transportation!!</li><li>We were overall blown away by Sydney, it’s a top tier city that is worth a visit. We loved the food, the parks, the people and the beaches.<figure><img src=/img/Apr13-19/reading.jpg></figure> </li></ul><h4 id=recommendations>Recommendations:</h4><ul><li>Bourke Street Bakery Surry Hills - must try the ginger crême brulée</li><li>Yes Thai! We loved the Pad Tom Yum and the Panang Curry with delicious coconut rice!</li><li>Cockatoo Island - with audio tour</li><li>Mountain Culture Beer Co. Brewery in the blue mountains that Will loved!</li><li>The Winery on Crown Street - the vibes don’t get better than this</li></ul><p><figure><img src=/img/Apr13-19/winery.jpg></figure> </p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://swillasnomads.github.io./js/jquery.min.js></script>
