We figured if we had a nice airbnb with a view, it would still be nice to relax in warm rainy weather. And I was very much looking forward to the plan being “relax”. Will and I have learned that if you don’t plan for explicit relaxation/chill days, then you don’t get them. Granted, days get filled up with epic adventures, but sometimes we have to force ourselves to recharge (or at least I certainly do, Will goes along with it).</p><p><figure><img src=/img/Apr24-28/will_bed.jpg></figure> </p><p>Turns out our decision was the right one. We had 2 days of rain where we caught up on blog posts (we’re behind again), and relaxed by swimming in the rain and reading. Our last two days were epic boat trips.</p><p>I’ll fast forward to the boat trips, cause we have the most pictures and because I remember them best.</p><h3 id=sailing-day---april-27>Sailing Day - April 27</h3><p>This particular boat had been unable to go out for a week due to the storm winds the islands had been subject to, but luck was on our side and we sailed out on a beautiful sunny day (more than one person burnt on our trip).</p><p><figure><img src=/img/Apr24-28/selfie_boat.jpg></figure> </p><p>The trip was insanely peaceful. We were sailing on a BYOB catamaran that slowly moved through the beauty of the whitsundays.</p><p><figure><img src=/img/Apr24-28/will_apple.jpg></figure> </p><p>We made two stops, one on a nature reserve island to walk around and another snorkeling spot (where we saw the largest sea clam I have ever seen - over a meter in length. It should make an appearance in the video compilation of this trip).</p><p>We would recommend the trip.</p><p><figure><img src=/img/Apr24-28/sunset.jpg></figure> </p><h3 id=speed-boating---april-28>Speed Boating - April 28</h3><p>This day was epic, but definitely less relaxing. We were warned about sitting at the front of the boat, but we did so anyway. The trip was akin to a splash zone rollercoaster. So exhilarating at the beginning and feared by the end of the trip while you’re shivering on board and all your stuff is wet. Footage of that to come.</p><p>However, the speed of the boat allowed us to fit in two snorkel spots and a mandatory trip to Whitehaven beach; the most picturesque beach. The sand swirls in turquoise water and the shallow waters house manta rays and lemon sharks both of which you can see by wading out into the water. The reef that wasn’t damaged by the cyclone in 2013 was spectacular (I’m running out of positive adjectives here), and the fish gigantic.</p><p><h4>spot the spider</h4><div id=myCarousel class="carousel slide" data-ride=carousel><ol class=carousel-indicators><li data-target=#myCarousel data-slide-to=0 class=active></li><li data-target=#myCarousel data-slide-to=1></li><li data-target=#myCarousel data-slide-to=2></li><li data-target=#myCarousel data-slide-to=3></li><li data-target=#myCarousel data-slide-to=4></li><li data-target=#myCarousel data-slide-to=5></li></ol><div class=carousel-inner><div class="item active"><img src=/img/Apr24-28/whitsunday_selfie.jpg alt style=width:100%></div><div class=item><img src=/img/Apr24-28/will_tree.jpg alt style=width:100%></div><div class=item><img src=/img/Apr24-28/whitehaven.jpg alt style=width:100%></div><div class=item><img src=/img/Apr24-28/will_walking.jpg alt style=width:100%></div><div class=item><img src=/img/Apr24-28/sam_tree.jpg alt style=width:100%></div><div class=item><img src=/img/Apr24-28/spider.jpg alt style=width:100%></div></div><a class="left carousel-control" href=#myCarousel data-slide=prev><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left"></span>
