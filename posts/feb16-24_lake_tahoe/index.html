Naturally we were more inclined to ski Heavenly, and after multiple conversations with strangers on chairlifts, we concluded that Kirkwood was worth a visit and that we could comfortably skip North Star. In the end, we‚Äôre incredibly happy we skied Heavenly the most, we found great runs and were blessed with the largest snowfall yet.</p></blockquote><p><figure><img src=/img/Feb16-24/trees_lake.jpg></figure>¬†</p><h3 id=lake-tahoe>Lake Tahoe</h3><p>The beginning of our stay in Lake Tahoe continued our unfortunate trend of little snow, lots of ice which made the terrain harder to ski and less pleasant. Thankfully we could still enjoy the views, enjoy some spring skiing in February and Will was still able to run me through some drills!</p><p><figure><img src=/img/Feb16-24/will_ski_view.jpg></figure>¬†</p><p>The magic came on Tuesday, February 22nd, the day after President‚Äôs day long weekend in the States (the resorts had been packed with people over the long weekend). We were expecting to receive something like 10cms of snow, but we woke up to find something closer to 30+ cm! Which at the top of the resort felt at times like closer to 45cm! We got to the chairs early, and were able to lay down lots of first tracks through the trees.</p><p><figure><img src=/img/Feb16-24/will_dump_trees.jpg></figure>¬†</p><p>But the real marvel came when we ventured up to the top of the mountain to make our way over to the double black section of the resort (Mott Canyon).</p><p>Quick side story:</p><blockquote><p>We had done one run in Mott Canyon early in the week, appropriately called ‚ÄúWidow Maker‚Äù, and I have never been so paralyzed coming down a run. I didn‚Äôt take off my skis but I sure came close.</p></blockquote><p>So I think I surprised both myself and Will when I agreed to go back to that section of the mountain. I figured a dumping of snow would make the runs more doable for someone with my skill level.</p><p>Though, when we got to the top of the chairlift, we saw signs saying that Mott Canyon was closed. So that was unfortunate, but we still decided to go ski the trees adjacent to the Canyon since they had been enjoyable without snow a few days back. And as we‚Äôre skiing these adjacent trees, we come across the entrances to Mott Canyon and see that the chairlift is operating and the gates have <strong>JUST</strong> been opened.</p><p>And so, through sheer luck, Will and I were able to ski down completely untouched 30+cm powder double black diamonds at Heavenly Lake. And let me tell you, it was heavenly. It was utter joy. We lapped that chair until the terrain became skied out. The whole time you could hear skiers hooting and hollering at the conditions. Will was even filmed by someone on the chair as he professionally (or recklessly‚Ä¶ üßê) ripped it down the run.</p><p><strong>[We have lots of skiing footage from this day - be sure to check out Will&rsquo;s video]</strong></p><p>This one day of powder skiing has made the whole ski trip. And was a large testament for us to how snow conditions make or break a resort.</p><p><figure><img src=/img/Feb16-24/sam_skiing.jpg></figure>¬†</p><h3 id=quick-shoutout-to-our-airbnb>Quick shoutout to our airbnb</h3><p>We were worried about having a studio apartment for 10 days. Since as most of you know, I sleep more than Will and so having a door to continue sleeping is normally key. But in the end, Will, as always, was incredibly considerate in the mornings, I was able to get my sleep, and the unit served all of our needs perfectly. We could play boardgames, cook all our meals (we didn‚Äôt go out once!), do our laundry and due to the warm weather early on, enjoy our balcony. This airbnb had the best views we‚Äôve had all trip and the best sunsets (sorry Astoria).</p><p><h4>Staring out over Nevada</h4><div id=myCarousel class="carousel slide" data-ride=carousel><ol class=carousel-indicators><li data-target=#myCarousel data-slide-to=0 class=active></li><li data-target=#myCarousel data-slide-to=1></li><li data-target=#myCarousel data-slide-to=2></li><li data-target=#myCarousel data-slide-to=3></li><li data-target=#myCarousel data-slide-to=4></li><li data-target=#myCarousel data-slide-to=5></li><li data-target=#myCarousel data-slide-to=6></li></ol><div class=carousel-inner><div class="item active"><img src=/img/Feb16-24/apres_balcony.jpg alt style=width:100%></div><div class=item><img src=/img/Feb16-24/boardgame_sunset.jpg alt style=width:100%></div><div class=item><img src=/img/Feb16-24/cinamon.jpg alt style=width:100%></div><div class=item><img src=/img/Feb16-24/sam_by_fire.jpg alt style=width:100%></div><div class=item><img src=/img/Feb16-24/sunset_balcony_snow.jpg alt style=width:100%></div><div class=item><img src=/img/Feb16-24/sunset.jpg alt style=width:100%></div><div class=item><img src=/img/Feb16-24/burrito.jpg alt style=width:100%></div></div><a class="left carousel-control" href=#myCarousel data-slide=prev><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left"></span>

And I would like to add that I won the first game we played and reluctantly agreed to play again even though I knew Will would win (and he did). And since the man is very competitive we had to play a third round, which happily for me, we tied (68-68). I think that‚Äôs kind of poetic.</p><p><figure><img src=/img/Feb16-24/duel.jpg></figure>¬†</p><h4 id=betty>Betty</h4><p>Oh, I almost forgot, the day we went to leave Lake Tahoe, Friday Morning, Betty decided not to start. We had to find a kind stranger who was not only willing to let us use their car for a boost, but also had jumper cables‚Ä¶ (We did, but it took an hour).</p><p><figure><img src=/img/Feb16-24/betty.jpg></figure>¬†</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://swillasnomads.github.io./js/jquery.min.js></script>
