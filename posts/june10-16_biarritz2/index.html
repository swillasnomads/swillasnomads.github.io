And we were stoked to get to share our little oasis with them. Though they did arrive a little/very jet lagged.</p><p><figure><img src=/img/June10-16/liam_sleep.jpg></figure> </p><blockquote><p>Note: Kae and Liam both brought film cameras. And the results from the realms of film are a wonderful encapsulation of the week. I&rsquo;ll showcase them in a separate bonus post - make sure you check them out 📷!</p></blockquote><p>The week honestly went by in a bit of a blur. Having them there forced Will and I to be a little bit more touristy and thus we threw ourselves at everything Biarritz had to offer. We hit up the coastal sites, shopped (while Will worked on his french, ahaha), went up the phare (lighthouse), beached and ate (a lot).</p><p><div id=myCarousel class="carousel slide" data-ride=carousel><ol class=carousel-indicators><li data-target=#myCarousel data-slide-to=0 class=active></li><li data-target=#myCarousel data-slide-to=1></li><li data-target=#myCarousel data-slide-to=2></li><li data-target=#myCarousel data-slide-to=3></li><li data-target=#myCarousel data-slide-to=4></li><li data-target=#myCarousel data-slide-to=5></li><li data-target=#myCarousel data-slide-to=6></li><li data-target=#myCarousel data-slide-to=7></li><li data-target=#myCarousel data-slide-to=8></li><li data-target=#myCarousel data-slide-to=9></li><li data-target=#myCarousel data-slide-to=10></li><li data-target=#myCarousel data-slide-to=11></li><li data-target=#myCarousel data-slide-to=12></li><li data-target=#myCarousel data-slide-to=13></li></ol><div class=carousel-inner><div class="item active"><img src=/img/June10-16/group_selfie.jpg alt style=width:100%></div><div class=item><img src=/img/June10-16/crepes.jpg alt style=width:100%></div><div class=item><img src=/img/June10-16/liam_at_night.jpg alt style=width:100%></div><div class=item><img src=/img/June10-16/liam_kae_will.jpg alt style=width:100%></div><div class=item><img src=/img/June10-16/liam_photo_kae.jpg alt style=width:100%></div><div class=item><img src=/img/June10-16/night_sky.jpg alt style=width:100%></div><div class=item><img src=/img/June10-16/phare_group_shot.jpg alt style=width:100%></div><div class=item><img src=/img/June10-16/phare.jpg alt style=width:100%></div><div class=item><img src=/img/June10-16/shopping_selfie.jpg alt style=width:100%></div><div class=item><img src=/img/June10-16/will_beach_board.jpg alt style=width:100%></div><div class=item><img src=/img/June10-16/will_liam_chairs.jpg alt style=width:100%></div><div class=item><img src=/img/June10-16/sam_will_wall.jpg alt style=width:100%></div><div class=item><img src=/img/June10-16/chickpea.jpg alt style=width:100%></div><div class=item><img src=/img/June10-16/liam_kae_selfie.jpg alt style=width:100%></div></div><a class="left carousel-control" href=#myCarousel data-slide=prev><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left"></span>

We were ordering a bunch of different tapas and decided we wanted to add fries to the mix (even though we were also ordering potatoes). However the fries that arrived had eyes. Turns out we hadn’t paid much attention to the word that came before “frites” - we had ordered little fried fish. Please enjoy the look on all our faces as we realized what was on the table.</p><p><figure><img src=/img/June10-16/frite.jpg></figure> </p><h4 id=vespas>Vespas.</h4><p>Small story time. When I first came to Biarritz, in 2017, I was fortunate enough to stay with a woman who was working on a Vespa and Surfboard rental service. So for the duration of my stay, she would vespa me around and I decided there and then that it was the best way to travel.</p><p><figure><img src=/img/June10-16/liam_sam_vespa.jpg></figure> </p><p>I wanted to share that joy with everyone else. So we rented two vibrantly coloured Vespas and set out to ride down the coast.</p><p><figure><img src=/img/June10-16/kae_vespa.jpg></figure> </p><p>The only regret, and major complaint of the day, was that we didn’t fully understand the inconsistent weather in the area, and all wore pants on what turned into a 30+ degree afternoon.</p><p>Thankfully, Kaelan and I aren’t prone to complain.</p><p><figure><img src=/img/June10-16/sam_kae_wall.jpg></figure> </p><p>We stopped in Bidart first, to get the sense of a less touristy basque town, eat lunch and view the coast.</p><p><figure><img src=/img/June10-16/bidart.jpg></figure> </p><p>The massive surprise for everyone was St-Jean de Luz. Our final destination for the day, this much larger than anticipated city is host to the longest pedestrian street I’ve ever walked (giving us switzerland ski village vibes), a church dating back to the 14th-15th century which was the site for the wedding of Louis XIV and Maria Theresa in 1660 and our new favourite beach.</p><p><figure><img src=/img/June10-16/luz.jpg></figure> </p><p>We also needed to see the coast before heading into the city.</p><p><figure><img src=/img/June10-16/rock_wall.jpg></figure> </p><p>At the point where we pulled into the city, we were all pretty much drenched in sweat. We all jumped at Will’s idea to have some ice cream. Before throwing ourselves into the water.</p><p><figure><img src=/img/June10-16/sam_kae_kick.jpg></figure> </p><p>Thankfully we had been smart enough to bring bathing suits even if we hadn’t brought shorts. What makes this beach so special, apart from the beautiful views and calm water, are the two floating diving docks out in the ocean. Unfortunately I don’t have any pictures, but Liam was flipping himself off the highest platform, Kaelan diving as if part of the olympics while Will and I alternated between various forms of pencil dives.</p><p><figure><img src=/img/June10-16/little_hats.jpg></figure> </p><p>We were so at peace (and finally refreshed) at the beach that we all forgot to look at the time. We almost didn’t make it back in time to return the Vespas. A vacant vacation mind if I ever saw one. Felt good.</p><p><figure><img src=/img/June10-16/walking.jpg></figure> </p><h4 id=surf-lessons>Surf Lessons.</h4><p>I know what you’re thinking. Aren’t you and Will pros by now? Couldn’t you teach both your friends what you’d learned? The answer is “most definitely not”. We had barely managed to get up once on our boards. I was desperate for a lesson, Will not so much, but thankfully with Kaelan and Liam eagerly wanting to join me, Will followed suit.</p><p><figure><img src=/img/June10-16/sam_will_instructor.jpg></figure> </p><p>And we had the most wonderful time. We hit a beautiful day. We had the instructor to ourselves (we booked our lesson 3 days before high season prices kicked in, so that was nice too!).</p><p><figure><img src=/img/June10-16/liam_kae_surf.jpg></figure> </p><p>It was Kaelan’s first time surfing and she was dubbed “the best beginner of the week”. No one had any doubts, but she crushed it, getting up on her board way more than once.</p><p><figure><img src=/img/June10-16/kae_wave.jpg></figure> </p><p><figure><img src=/img/June10-16/kae_jump.jpg></figure> </p><p>Liam refound his element on a surfboard, quickly leaving Kaelan and myself in the white wash with the instructor as he went out on his own.</p><p><figure><img src=/img/June10-16/liam_wave.jpg></figure> </p><p><figure><img src=/img/June10-16/liam_wave2.jpg></figure> </p><p>Will gets points for best and worst picture of the day.<figure><img src=/img/June10-16/will_big_wave.jpg></figure> </p><p><figure><img src=/img/June10-16/will_knees.jpg></figure> </p><p>And to his surprise, he learnt valuable tips from the instructors that have heavily improved his surfing since.</p><p><figure><img src=/img/June10-16/will_instructor.jpg></figure> </p><p>I also had a grand old time. I was able to get up on my big board (making me realize I really had bought a board that was too pro for me), turn slightly on a wave and gain the confidence I needed to practice what I had learnt on my own in the weeks to come.</p><p><figure><img src=/img/June10-16/sam_surf.jpg></figure> </p><p>Though at the end, my body was breaking down. I rode a wave too close to shore and could no longer go back. Kaelan was in a similar predicament. Felt like we were dying and laughing in a hard workout - just like old times.</p><p><figure><img src=/img/June10-16/liam_ok_sam_dead.jpg></figure> </p><p>Will, obviously was still going strong.</p><p><figure><img src=/img/June10-16/sam_kae_talking.jpg></figure> </p><p>Thank you Kaelan and Liam for stopping to see us on your way to Paris, I hope the detour was worth it 😝🥳.</p><p><figure><img src=/img/June10-16/cheers.jpg></figure> </p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://swillasnomads.github.io./js/jquery.min.js></script>
