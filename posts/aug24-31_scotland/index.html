Though who knows, maybe I’ll write up a reminiscent post later, but for now, let’s dive into our incredible adventures in Scotland.</p><h3 id=edinburgh-75th-fringe-festival>Edinburgh 75th Fringe Festival</h3><p>As Will and I trained over from York to Edinburgh (in our actual assigned seats!), my brother Jonathan, aka Johny, aka John and our friend Luis were flying over to the city from Dublin (in various stages of jetlag).</p><p><figure><img src=/img/Aug24-31/ed_3_backs.jpg></figure> </p><p>The reason for this reunion in Edinburgh was the one and only, Fringe Festival. Technically there are others around the world, but this one is the best (she says without ever having been to another).</p><p><figure><img src=/img/Aug24-31/ed_selfie.jpg></figure> </p><p>For those who are unfamiliar with the the Fringe Festival it is (from their own <a href=https://www.edfringe.com/experience/what-is-the-festival-fringe>website</a>):</p><blockquote><p>For three weeks in August, the city of Edinburgh welcomes an explosion of creative energy from around the globe. Artists and performers take to hundreds of stages all over the city to present shows for every taste. From big names in the world of entertainment to unknown artists looking to build their careers, the festival caters for everyone and includes theatre, comedy, dance, physical theatre, circus, cabaret, children&rsquo;s shows, musicals, opera, music, spoken word, exhibitions and events.</p></blockquote><p>The story goes, that when Johny and I were traveling together in the summer of 2017 (yes, the same summer I discovered Biarritz), we happened to plan our trip to Edinburgh over the Fringe, but we had no idea. We just thought hostels in Edinburgh were always so expensive. We didn’t clue in until a man at the airport on our flight to Edinburgh said something to the effect of “You must be coming for the Fringe!”, and we really didn’t know how to respond.</p><p><figure><img src=/img/Aug24-31/ed_view.jpg></figure> </p><p>And though we hadn’t come for the Fringe, we had the most amazing time. We saw bands, and acrobats and TONS of comedy (most of which were pay what you can). Add that entertainment to the beauty of the city and we vowed we’d come back.</p><p><figure><img src=/img/Aug24-31/ed_street.jpg></figure> </p><p>Fast forward to 2022 and we’re back with a crew, and more money. We attended way more paid venues this time around and all of it was money incredibly well spent.</p><p><figure><img src=/img/Aug24-31/ed_cards.jpg></figure> </p><p>We also spent a lot more time out on the streets interacting with buskers, I now follow a few more artists on spotify, which was a ton of fun. It helped that we had nice weather.</p><p><figure><img src=/img/Aug24-31/ed_busker.jpg></figure> </p><p>The only real downside was the bin strike. No garbage collection. The city was a mess. Really made you pause about the amount of garbage we produce, and also made you reconsider sitting outside on a patio if you had to smell the garbage wafting from a week old pile upwind from you. On the bright side, it gave comedians extra material.</p><p><figure><img src=/img/Aug24-31/ed_garbage1.jpg></figure> </p><h3 id=loch-ness>Loch Ness</h3><p>After spending money on all sorts of artists, we rented a manual car, Will swore he would figure out how to drive it and we headed north. The goal was to see the highlands and experience more of Scotlands nature and castles. However, we almost didn’t make it out of the parking lot with the rented car. Will couldn’t figure out how to reverse this particular manual car. That first half hour in the car was a little testy… I still voted we should have gotten an automatic, but to Will’s credit, he got us everywhere we needed to be, didn’t scratch the car or get us in an accident and all on the left side of the road.</p><p><figure><img src=/img/Aug24-31/urquhart_boys.jpg></figure> </p><p>When we finally left the busy streets of the big Scotland cities, we entered a beautiful world of mountains, lochs (aka lakes) and sheep. It reminded Will and I of New Zealand at times.</p><p><figure><img src=/img/Aug24-31/urquhart_will_luis.jpg></figure> </p><p>We had to go check out Nessie in her loch, and at the same time take a look at the ruins of an old castle. With an incredibly barbaric past between the Crown and the Scotland Clans. A recurring theme in Scotland. When this particular castle, Urquhart, was beginning to be too costly to defend, the Crown blew it up so that no others could use the remains as a stronghold.</p><p><figure><img src=/img/Aug24-31/urquhart_all4.jpg></figure> </p><p>It’s a miracle Nessie survived all the bloodshed.</p><p><figure><img src=/img/Aug24-31/urquhart_3.jpg></figure> </p><h3 id=isle-of-skye-castles--hikes>Isle of Skye: Castles & Hikes</h3><h4 id=eilean-donan-castle>Eilean Donan Castle</h4><p><figure><img src=/img/Aug24-31/eilean.jpg></figure> </p><p>The next day, Aug 27th, we set out for the Isle of Skye. The place I was most excited to visit. But before we crossed the bridge to the Island, we had a necessary stop at Eilean Donan Castle. One of the most picturesque castles in Scotland. You might be wondering, how is it standing? Why did no one blow it up? And those are the right questions to be asking. It actually had been blown up, and then rebuilt. Wikipedia says it best:</p><blockquote><p>The island&rsquo;s original castle was built in the thirteenth century; it became a stronghold of the Clan Mackenzie and their allies, the Clan MacRae. However, in response to the Mackenzies&rsquo; involvement in the Jacobite rebellions early in the 18th century, government ships destroyed the castle in 1719. The present-day castle is Lieutenant-Colonel John Macrae-Gilstrap&rsquo;s 20th-century reconstruction of the old castle.</p></blockquote><p><figure><img src=/img/Aug24-31/eilean_3boys.jpg></figure> </p><p>Sitting at the intersection of three lochs, the castle truly has beautiful views, and I guess also a very strategic position in medieval times.</p><p><figure><img src=/img/Aug24-31/eilean_selfie.jpg></figure> </p><h4 id=the-old-man-of-storr>The Old Man of Storr</h4><p><figure><img src=/img/Aug24-31/roadside_johny.jpg></figure> </p><p>Given our short time on the Isle of Skye, we had a jammed packed itinerary. So following the castle, and a lovely lunch on the grounds, we made our way to check out Old Man of Storr, so named because the outline of the rock resembles the profile of an old man.</p><p><figure><img src=/img/Aug24-31/storr_luis_rock.jpg></figure> </p><p>With a few scenic stops along the way - obviously.</p><p><figure><img src=/img/Aug24-31/roadside_johny_will.jpg></figure> </p><p>The scenery was only getting better and better.</p><p><figure><img src=/img/Aug24-31/storr_view.jpg></figure> </p><p>The Old Man of Storr hike is a must do. If you google Isle of Skye, pictures from this hike appear.</p><p><figure><img src=/img/Aug24-31/storr_will_luis.jpg></figure> </p><p>And it is only marked as a moderate hike on All Trails, which was all I could really handle at that time given that my leg was getting progressively worse. Not to mention our two companions had come traveling light and didn’t have all the hiking gear necessary for some more challenging terrain (though more on that in a bit).</p><p><figure><img src=/img/Aug24-31/storr_start.jpg></figure> </p><p>We all thoroughly enjoyed this hike, even if we showed up without the proper amount of water and it did drizzle a little bit on us. The views were striking and the air fresh and crisp.</p><p><figure><img src=/img/Aug24-31/storr_johny_sammy.jpg></figure> </p><h4 id=our-only-full-day-on-skye>Our Only Full Day on Skye</h4><p>The plan was for some roadside stops, a hike and a quick castle visit before heading back to Portree (near where we were staying for dinner).</p><p><figure><img src=/img/Aug24-31/kilt_rock_piggyback.jpg></figure> </p><h5 id=kilt-rock>Kilt Rock</h5><p>On Sunday we had a full day to explore, which started with a quick roadside stop to Kilt Rock, so named, because the very special rock formation looks like a Kilt.</p><p><figure><img src=/img/Aug24-31/kilt_rock.jpg></figure> </p><p>I’m happy I pushed for the stop, rocks are always cool and this one was surrounded by crystal clear water.</p><p><figure><img src=/img/Aug24-31/kilt_rock_view.jpg></figure> </p><h5 id=the-quiraing-circuit>The Quiraing Circuit</h5><p><figure><img src=/img/Aug24-31/q_hike_johny_back.jpg></figure> </p><p>Arriving at this hike, which we assumed would be similar to the one from the previous day (it was also rated moderate), we were yet again a little unprepared. Johny was desperately looking around trying to spot families with young kids, a way for him to gauge the difficulty of a hike… none were to be found. Instead we were being passed by couples in full patagonia gear, with hiking boots and poles. Thankfully though, Luis and Johny, in their gripless, water welcoming shoes, got some coffee to go, to give them some much needed energy.</p><p><figure><img src=/img/Aug24-31/q_hike_coffee.jpg></figure> </p><p>This hike was spectacular, though filled with water, mud and at times so many biting midges we literally couldn’t stop moving. Will and I assumed the challenging nature of the hike would dampen more than shoes. But in the end everyone kept a high spirit, due in part no doubt to the ever changing sweeping views the hike offered, and the satisfaction of a job well done. That and once we had started the loop, there was no turning back, lest we drudge back through the midges territory.</p><p><div id=myCarousel class="carousel slide" data-ride=carousel><ol class=carousel-indicators><li data-target=#myCarousel data-slide-to=0 class=active></li><li data-target=#myCarousel data-slide-to=1></li><li data-target=#myCarousel data-slide-to=2></li><li data-target=#myCarousel data-slide-to=3></li><li data-target=#myCarousel data-slide-to=4></li></ol><div class=carousel-inner><div class="item active"><img src=/img/Aug24-31/q_hike_scenary.jpg alt style=width:100%></div><div class=item><img src=/img/Aug24-31/q_hike_will.jpg alt style=width:100%></div><div class=item><img src=/img/Aug24-31/q_hike_J_L.jpg alt style=width:100%></div><div class=item><img src=/img/Aug24-31/q_hike_johny_hurt.jpg alt style=width:100%></div><div class=item><img src=/img/Aug24-31/q_hike_shoes.jpg alt style=width:100%></div></div><a class="left carousel-control" href=#myCarousel data-slide=prev><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left"></span>

<span class=sr-only>Next</span></a></div> </p><p>We ended the hike and lined up for some hot dogs and hamburgers from the only chip truck at the trailhead. The mustard was dubbed “American Mustard”, because English mustard was stronger and not to be associated with the yellow stuff we have here. The food was warm and delicious though, exactly what the doctor had ordered.</p><p><figure><img src=/img/Aug24-31/q_hike_will_back.jpg></figure> </p><h5 id=dunvegan-castle--gardens>Dunvegan Castle & Gardens</h5><p><figure><img src=/img/Aug24-31/dunvegan_view_will.jpg></figure> </p><p>We boogied across the island in order to visit our second last castle, which has also had many renovations over the years and is actually still inhabited by the family. Imagine having your Christmas celebrations in a castle ancestral home? Wild.</p><p><figure><img src=/img/Aug24-31/dunvegan_outside.jpg></figure> </p><p>From the outside this castle wasn’t too spectacular but the rooms on the inside, renovated in the 19th century (something like that - don’t quote me), were beautiful and made us feel like we were in the set of Downton Abbey.</p><p><figure><img src=/img/Aug24-31/dunvegan_inside.jpg></figure> </p><p>What took the cake for this visit were the grounds, the gardens. Where we found out that a young clan chief (6 years of age), sometime long ago, fired the gardener and abandoned the garden because he had no use for such things. Shocking that a 6 year old didn’t want fresh cabbage…</p><p><figure><img src=/img/Aug24-31/dunvegan_gardens.jpg></figure> </p><p>The castle wrapped up our busy visiting schedule of the Isle and we made our way back to the city to queue up and attempt to get into one of the few pubs that wasn’t already booked solid (looks like they had had staff shortages and also everyone was closed on Sundays). I will admit I was a little hangry waiting around for our table, but buying tea biscuits from the grocery store did tide me over until we could eat what turned out to be a delicious meal.</p><p><figure><img src=/img/Aug24-31/portree_hungry.jpg></figure> </p><h3 id=stirling-castle>Stirling Castle</h3><p>On our last day with our companions, we drove back towards civilization and obviously made one last stop at Stirling Castle. Personally, it was not my favourite in terms of look and views. But, it was the most interesting from a history perspective, and it was the only castle we visited with still standing structures built in medieval times. So I guess, in the end, I would recommend visiting it!</p><p><figure><img src=/img/Aug24-31/stirling_casle_chairs.jpg></figure> </p><p>We dropped Johnny off at the train station before dinner as he headed back to Edinburgh for a flight to Dublin, a sleep at the airport before a flight home (yikes..). And we had a final dinner and pub drinks with Luis, before having to drop him off at the train station as well, though at least he had a sleeper train to sleep on as he made his journey to Croatia. And Will and I mentally prepared for our journey home.</p><p><figure><img src=/img/Aug24-31/stirling_3.jpg></figure> </p><h3 id=journey-home>Journey Home</h3><p>We were ready to go home. I think in large part the sabbatical goals had been achieved after France, and we were also very short on money for the last month of our travels which made it a little bit more difficult. But truly, we were ready to settle down somewhere and be able to cook all our meals once more. And become productive members of society.</p><p><figure><img src=/img/Aug24-31/office.jpg></figure> </p><p>We wake up at 5am, drop off the rental car, make our way to the terminal to find out that our plane has been delayed by 24hours. I’m so tired that I hear 4 hours, and I’m thinking that’s not the end of the world, but no, 24hours. We have another full day before we go home.</p><p><figure><img src=/img/Aug24-31/sam_airport.jpg></figure> </p><p>We tell the attendants we will need hotel accommodations, they tell us to come back to the counter in 2 hours. We settle in at starbucks, have breakfast, and veg. We go back in 2 hours, but the line is so long we go back to starbucks and wait some more. We finally get seen and they give us a voucher with 15 pounds each to spend on breakfast and we’re told to come back at 11am. We’ve already had breakfast. So we spend all our money at the grocery store, and the best part, on a souvenir mug from Starbucks (not going to lie, I love the mug).</p><p><figure><img src=/img/Aug24-31/will_airport.jpg></figure> </p><p>At 11am, we go back to the counter, where we’re told a coach is waiting to take us to our hotel, in Edinburgh (we are currently in Glasgow). We sleepily get on the coach, it takes us an hour and a bit to get to the hotel, we have a lunch provided. We meet a Scotish man named Johnny, he’s traveling alone to go see his best friend in Canada, he has recently lost his wife and we tell him we’ll meet up with him again at dinner. We somehow spend the day, doing nothing, going on a walk, working on the blog.</p><p><figure><img src=/img/Aug24-31/coach.jpg></figure> </p><p>Dinner comes around and we eat at the buffet and talk with Johnny. We try and eat early so we can go to bed early, because the best part is, our coach back to the airport in the morning leaves at 3h30am. You want to complain, but there’s no one to complain to.</p><p><figure><img src=/img/Aug24-31/sam_airport_sleep.jpg></figure> </p><p>We attempt to fall asleep at 9pm. It works so-so.</p><p>And then the next day, at 3am, we start the whole travel day over again. This time we get on the flight, we’re so exhausted we sleep through good chunks of it.</p><p><figure><img src=/img/Aug24-31/airport_selfie.jpg></figure> </p><p>Next thing you know we are landing in Toronto, fearful that our bagage hasn’t made it, because Pearson is supposed to be a mess. But they have arrived, they are already on the conveyor belt. We grab our things, and make our way to the uber pick up area.</p><p>We’re finally back.</p><p><figure><img src=/img/Aug24-31/will_trolley.jpg></figure> </p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://swillasnomads.github.io./js/jquery.min.js></script>
