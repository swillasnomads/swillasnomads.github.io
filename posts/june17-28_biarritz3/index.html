We successfully set it up (though didn&rsquo;t use all the screws) and it was essential in helping us sleep through the next few nights. I’ll never take air conditioning for granted again.</p><p><figure><img src=/img/June17-28/fan.jpg></figure> </p><p>After days of heat, the apartment was impossible to cool down, I can remember my sweeping relief when the winds finally picked up and the temperature dropped to 27 degrees - it felt like winter.</p><p><figure><img src=/img/June17-28/41_degrees.jpg></figure> </p><p>Unfortunately, the turn in temperature lasted quite a bit of time, corresponding with my parents’ week in Biarritz. We went from wearing the bare minimum, to wearing fleeces and sleeping with duvets.</p><p><figure><img src=/img/June17-28/bayonne_me_parents.jpg></figure> </p><h3 id=rainy-days>Rainy Days</h3><p>My parents were good sports about the 4/7 rainy days they experienced. On those days, we rested, played some card games (being 4 allowed us to expand our game repertoire - welcome euchre!) and went for walks during breaks in the rain. Will was also finalizing his week long intensive french course! He’s now certified A2!</p><p><figure><img src=/img/June17-28/will_sam_dad.jpg></figure> </p><p>Amidst the rain, I was still able to show my parents the coastal landmarks. This included the climb up the gazillion steps up the phare (lighthouse) lookout for the second time in 2 weeks.</p><p><figure><img src=/img/June17-28/phare.jpg></figure> </p><p>We also made it to my favourite bar a couple times, but both times we were rained out and forced home.</p><p><figure><img src=/img/June17-28/bar_parents_sangria.jpg></figure> </p><p><figure><img src=/img/June17-28/bar_rain.jpg></figure> </p><p><figure><img src=/img/June17-28/leaving_bar.jpg></figure> </p><p>Once we had gotten my mom a wet suit we were able to follow Will’s lead and go swimming in the rain.</p><p><figure><img src=/img/June17-28/will_swim.jpg></figure> </p><p>It was so much fun to enjoy the stormy ocean without being cold. We’re definitely getting our money’s worth out of our suits.</p><p><figure><img src=/img/June17-28/swim_3.jpg></figure> </p><p>Bayonne provided the perfect rainy getaway, a 30 minute bus ride away, we revisited the old medieval downtown, quickly touring the church and settling in for a quick drink before heading back to Biarritz.</p><p><figure><img src=/img/June17-28/bayonne_artsy.jpg></figure> </p><p><figure><img src=/img/June17-28/bayonne_view.jpg></figure> </p><p><figure><img src=/img/June17-28/bayonne_walking.jpg></figure> </p><h3 id=sunny-days>Sunny Days</h3><p><figure><img src=/img/June17-28/balcony_salad.jpg></figure> </p><p>Any chance we got we would eat outside, making full use of the balcony - we did get some pretty spectacular sunsets.</p><p><figure><img src=/img/June17-28/sunset.jpg></figure> </p><p>And we were smart. On the two expected sunny days we planned our day trips.</p><h4 id=vespa-day>Vespa Day!</h4><p><figure><img src=/img/June17-28/stj_will_me.jpg></figure> </p><p>If you’ve been reading all my long blog posts you’ll know how much I love vespas, especially here. So we had to recreate the vespa day with my parents.</p><p><figure><img src=/img/June17-28/scooter_3.jpg></figure> </p><p>I think it’s safe to say we all had an incredible day, everyone had a smile plastered on their faces from the ride.</p><p>We stopped again in Bidart for lunch, trying out a multitude of basque style tapas. We definitely ordered too much, but thankfully Will and my dad seem to be bottomless pits (at least for bread and meat).</p><p><figure><img src=/img/June17-28/bidart_food.jpg></figure> </p><p>St-Jean de Luz was everything we remembered it to be, we spent a good amount of time at the beach. Most of us went for a swim (my mom thought the water was too cold). Will and I practiced our dives off the floating docks once more, it was by no means pretty, but was it ever fun.</p><p><figure><img src=/img/June17-28/stj_parents.jpg></figure> </p><p>That day, Saint-Jean de Luz was teaming with people, all gathered to celebrate La Saint-Jean Baptiste on June 24th (felt like we were back in Montreal, except for all the basque colours, and massive parade).</p><p><figure><img src=/img/June17-28/giants.jpg></figure> </p><h4 id=spain-day>Spain Day!</h4><p><figure><img src=/img/June17-28/san_seb_selfie.jpg></figure> </p><p>Biarritz is located 35km from the Spanish border. Yet, we hadn’t been to visit the nearest city, Donostia-San Sebastian, until my parents came around and organized it. Sometimes you just need parental guidance.</p><p><figure><img src=/img/June17-28/san_seb_by_sea.jpg></figure> </p><p>Though I don’t recommend Blah Blah bus to anyone (we arrived over 2 hours later than scheduled), the city of San Sebastian is beautiful and surprisingly massive. We spent most of our time in the old town, characterized by it’s small medieval streets and abundance of pintxos restaurants (tapas).</p><p><figure><img src=/img/June17-28/san_seb_walking.jpg></figure> </p><p>The pintxos were part of our mission while visiting, we wanted to try a bunch. And though some of them were delicious, by and large they were incredibly salty and vegetables were impossible to find. We actually went by a fruit vendor after lunch to buy some produce because our systems were so oversalted and over meated. But hey, we tried it 🤷🏼‍♀️.</p><p><figure><img src=/img/June17-28/san_seb_will.jpg></figure> </p><p>The city is also flanked by two massive beaches. And given we actually had nice weather that day, we all went for a very refreshing swim (we weren&rsquo;t the only ones with that idea).</p><p><figure><img src=/img/June17-28/san_seb_beach.jpg></figure> </p><p><figure><img src=/img/June17-28/sam_dad_swim.jpg></figure> </p><p>Mom and dad if you’re reading this (which you better be), Will and I are so happy you came to visit. The memories will not soon be forgotten and we’ll be forever grateful for all the wonderful meals and drinks you treated us to. Merci beaucoup!</p><p><div id=myCarousel class="carousel slide" data-ride=carousel><ol class=carousel-indicators><li data-target=#myCarousel data-slide-to=0 class=active></li><li data-target=#myCarousel data-slide-to=1></li><li data-target=#myCarousel data-slide-to=2></li><li data-target=#myCarousel data-slide-to=3></li><li data-target=#myCarousel data-slide-to=4></li><li data-target=#myCarousel data-slide-to=5></li><li data-target=#myCarousel data-slide-to=6></li><li data-target=#myCarousel data-slide-to=7></li><li data-target=#myCarousel data-slide-to=8></li><li data-target=#myCarousel data-slide-to=9></li><li data-target=#myCarousel data-slide-to=10></li></ol><div class=carousel-inner><div class="item active"><img src=/img/June17-28/balcony_3.jpg alt style=width:100%></div><div class=item><img src=/img/June17-28/bidart.jpg alt style=width:100%></div><div class=item><img src=/img/June17-28/san_seb_ice_cream.jpg alt style=width:100%></div><div class=item><img src=/img/June17-28/empty_beach.jpg alt style=width:100%></div><div class=item><img src=/img/June17-28/ice_cream.jpg alt style=width:100%></div><div class=item><img src=/img/June17-28/sam_surf.jpg alt style=width:100%></div><div class=item><img src=/img/June17-28/bird.jpg alt style=width:100%></div><div class=item><img src=/img/June17-28/bayonne_etxe.jpg alt style=width:100%></div><div class=item><img src=/img/June17-28/sam_storm.jpg alt style=width:100%></div><div class=item><img src=/img/June17-28/broken_board.jpg alt style=width:100%></div><div class=item><img src=/img/June17-28/san_seb_sam.jpg alt style=width:100%></div></div><a class="left carousel-control" href=#myCarousel data-slide=prev><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left"></span>
