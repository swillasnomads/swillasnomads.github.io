We were finally able to put the shorts we brought to good use! We spent a weekend in San Francisco before driving down Highway 1 to LA over 2 days. The stunning views were endless.</p><h3 id=san-francisco-not-to-be-called-san-fran>San Francisco (Not to be called San Fran…)</h3><p>We spent a wonderful weekend with Will’s uncle Eric and his husband Philip in their beautiful home in San Francisco. We spent the weekend exploring this city of hills. Philip was explaining to us that when the city was built, the standard design was to use a grid, which works well for a flat city like New York but definitely makes for a distinctive feature in a city full of ups and downs. Eric did actually drive us down the steepest street in San Francisco and it was like the drop of a rollercoaster, I couldn’t understand how the parked cars weren’t falling over.</p><p><figure><img src=/img/Feb25-Mar2/will_uncles.jpg></figure> </p><h4 id=saturday-highlights--recommendations>Saturday Highlights & Recommendations:</h4><ul><li><strong>Crissy Field Park:</strong> An old airfield turned park offers the most beautiful views of the golden gate bridge. We were also lucky enough to make long eye contact with a local seal (though I don’t have photo evidence).<figure><img src=/img/Feb25-Mar2/sam_will_bridge.jpg></figure> </li><li><strong>Lombard street:</strong> We both drove and walked this really cool switch back street.<figure><img src=/img/Feb25-Mar2/lombard.jpg></figure> </li><li><strong>Coit Tower:</strong> A place to enjoy views of the city and beautiful frescas on the inside of the tower (you can also pay to ascend to the top).</li><li><strong>Mission District:</strong> A really lively neighborhood, with plenty of places to eat and shop. The tacos and margaritas we had were particularly good - though finding parking was particularly hard.</li><li><strong>Homemade lemon curd:</strong> Not something you can get unless you know Eric and Philip, but if you do, you must taste it. It’s mouth wateringly good.</li></ul><p><figure><img src=/img/Feb25-Mar2/all_four.jpg></figure> </p><ul><li><strong>The Lookout:</strong> A dynamic bar overlooking Castro street! Philip and I really enjoyed their fruity cocktail special of the day.</li></ul><h4 id=sunday-highlights--recommendations>Sunday Highlights & Recommendations:</h4><ul><li><strong>Dolores Park:</strong> The place to chill on a sunny SF day. Though a word to the wise, make sure you bring a waterproof blanket to sit on, our car blankets got a few posteriors very wet 😅.</li></ul><p><figure><img src=/img/Feb25-Mar2/park_hang.jpg></figure> </p><ul><li><strong>Muir Woods National Monument:</strong> The closest Red Wood forest to San Francisco, they get something like 1M visitors a year and it is quite special, though not free. I would recommend spending a few hours at the park and enjoying the serenity of the woods. We were lucky to have Matthias join us for this mini adventure and it made it all the more pleasant.</li></ul><p><figure><img src=/img/Feb25-Mar2/redwood_boys.jpg></figure> </p><p><figure><img src=/img/Feb25-Mar2/on_car.jpg></figure> </p><h3 id=highway-1>Highway 1</h3><p>The most scenic drive you will ever do.</p><p>Will and I completed the drive in 2 days (4.5hour drive/day) since we wanted to give ourselves 2 full days in the Utah Natinoal Parks, but if we were to do it again we would budget for a 3 day drive. There are just SO MANY places to stop along the way and you definitely need to do it while there is daylight. That being said we still had a blast, just needed to skip a few stops (I had been overly ambitious in our planning). The highlight for me was seeing the elephant seal rookery in San Simeon.</p><p><h4>Select Few Pictures from Drive</h4><div id=myCarousel class="carousel slide" data-ride=carousel><ol class=carousel-indicators><li data-target=#myCarousel data-slide-to=0 class=active></li><li data-target=#myCarousel data-slide-to=1></li><li data-target=#myCarousel data-slide-to=2></li><li data-target=#myCarousel data-slide-to=3></li><li data-target=#myCarousel data-slide-to=4></li><li data-target=#myCarousel data-slide-to=5></li><li data-target=#myCarousel data-slide-to=6></li><li data-target=#myCarousel data-slide-to=7></li><li data-target=#myCarousel data-slide-to=8></li></ol><div class=carousel-inner><div class="item active"><img src=/img/Feb25-Mar2/coast_bridge.jpg alt style=width:100%></div><div class=item><img src=/img/Feb25-Mar2/selfie_beach.jpg alt style=width:100%></div><div class=item><img src=/img/Feb25-Mar2/Seal.jpg alt style=width:100%></div><div class=item><img src=/img/Feb25-Mar2/turtle.jpg alt style=width:100%></div><div class=item><img src=/img/Feb25-Mar2/will_vans.jpg alt style=width:100%></div><div class=item><img src=/img/Feb25-Mar2/selfie_2.jpg alt style=width:100%></div><div class=item><img src=/img/Feb25-Mar2/coast.jpg alt style=width:100%></div><div class=item><img src=/img/Feb25-Mar2/sam_seal.jpg alt style=width:100%></div><div class=item><img src=/img/Feb25-Mar2/sam_sunset.jpg alt style=width:100%></div></div><a class="left carousel-control" href=#myCarousel data-slide=prev><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left"></span>

I swear we saw a few that advertised a particular actor, as if this was a part of their outreach or networking plan.</li></ul><h5 id=recommendation>Recommendation:</h5><ul><li><strong>Night Market</strong> is a MUST. Such amazing street Thai food with great wine to match. Make sure you try the mango cocout sticky rice. & make sure you get a reservation and show up on time&mldr; lol</li></ul></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://swillasnomads.github.io./js/jquery.min.js></script>
