I didnâ€™t particularly like disc golf, discs donâ€™t throw anything like frisbees, and having Will meticulously counting attempts added to the frustration. So we moved to a new model, Sam doesnâ€™t count her shots and can cheat whenever (the same way I play golf actually), and Will counts his score and plays by all the rules. We both had fun in the end.</p><p><figure><img src=/img/May12-16/queenstown_disc.jpg></figure>Â </p><h3 id=wanaka>Wanaka</h3><p>We were spending two nights in Wanaka to allow ourselves a full day to complete Royâ€™s Peak Track. A 5 star hike on All Trails reviewed by over a thousand people, estimated to take 6hours to complete, we knew we were in for a treat. The trail is 16.3km of pure switch-back for 1,305 meters of elevation.</p><p><figure><img src=/img/May12-16/hike_perspective.jpg></figure>Â </p><p><figure><img src=/img/May12-16/roys_all_trails.jpg></figure>Â </p><p>That dreadchury aside, the hike provides the most stunning views for the whole 6 hours. The kind of views that alleviate the mounting pain in your body.</p><p><figure><img src=/img/May12-16/roys_view3.jpg></figure>Â </p><p>Itâ€™s my new favourite hike, or maybe tied with Angelâ€™s Landing (if you donâ€™t know what Iâ€™m referring to check out our Zion Video ðŸ˜œ), Iâ€™m still torn.</p><p><figure><img src=/img/May12-16/sam_summit.jpg></figure>Â </p><p>I had this idea in my head of New Zealand, massive blue lakes surrounded by jutting mountains, and nature for as far as the eye can see. I thought I would see it in Milford Sound, but Milford was another kind of beauty (in all honesty, I was a little disappointed - crazy what expectations can do for your enjoyment of something objectively spectacular).</p><p><figure><img src=/img/May12-16/sam_will_viewpoint.jpg></figure>Â </p><p>All this to say, Royâ€™s Peak delivered my fancible image of New Zealand in spades. Will and I listened to podcasts on our grueling walk up, danced to tunes, crossed cows and lots of cow dung, and as is typical of our adventures, had the tippy top to us alone for a 45min lunch (of cheese, broken crackers, an unsliced cucumber and carrot and some nuts).</p><p><div id=myCarousel class="carousel slide" data-ride=carousel><ol class=carousel-indicators><li data-target=#myCarousel data-slide-to=0 class=active></li><li data-target=#myCarousel data-slide-to=1></li><li data-target=#myCarousel data-slide-to=2></li><li data-target=#myCarousel data-slide-to=3></li><li data-target=#myCarousel data-slide-to=4></li><li data-target=#myCarousel data-slide-to=5></li><li data-target=#myCarousel data-slide-to=6></li><li data-target=#myCarousel data-slide-to=7></li><li data-target=#myCarousel data-slide-to=8></li><li data-target=#myCarousel data-slide-to=9></li></ol><div class=carousel-inner><div class="item active"><img src=/img/May12-16/selfie_roys.jpg alt style=width:100%></div><div class=item><img src=/img/May12-16/will_lunch_roys.jpg alt style=width:100%></div><div class=item><img src=/img/May12-16/cow2.jpg alt style=width:100%></div><div class=item><img src=/img/May12-16/will_roys.jpg alt style=width:100%></div><div class=item><img src=/img/May12-16/diff_view_roys.jpg alt style=width:100%></div><div class=item><img src=/img/May12-16/will_roys2.jpg alt style=width:100%></div><div class=item><img src=/img/May12-16/roys_view4.jpg alt style=width:100%></div><div class=item><img src=/img/May12-16/will_walking_roys.jpg alt style=width:100%></div><div class=item><img src=/img/May12-16/sam_bottom.jpg alt style=width:100%></div><div class=item><img src=/img/May12-16/roys_stats.jpg alt style=width:100%></div></div><a class="left carousel-control" href=#myCarousel data-slide=prev><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left"></span>

Hereâ€™s our picture.</p><p><figure><img src=/img/May12-16/wanaka_selfie.jpg></figure>Â </p><p>Hereâ€™s a slightly better picture.</p><p><figure><img src=/img/May12-16/wanaka_tree.jpg></figure>Â </p><h3 id=glacier-country>Glacier Country</h3><p><figure><img src=/img/May12-16/glacier_land.jpg></figure>Â </p><p>Between May 14th and the 16th, we were driving through glacier country in New Zealand, past Haast Blue Pools, Fox Glacier and Franz Joseph Glacier.</p><p><figure><img src=/img/May12-16/haast.jpg></figure>Â </p><p><figure><img src=/img/May12-16/bridge_sign.jpg></figure>Â </p><p>Our luck with the weather ran out. We were planning on doing a hike at each glacier, but given the rain and the Leafs game 7, we spent the 25th hunkered down in our holiday park.</p><p><figure><img src=/img/May12-16/leafs.jpg></figure>Â </p><p>We took a walk in the afternoon and played crib to try and lifts Willâ€™s broken spirits at yet another Leafâ€™s elimination day.</p><p><figure><img src=/img/May12-16/crib.jpg></figure>Â </p><p>Thankfully his spirits were well and truly lifted the next day when we completed Robertâ€™s Point Track.</p><p><figure><img src=/img/May12-16/will_bridge.jpg></figure>Â </p><p>Willâ€™s favourite day hike of the trip, probably even ever. This hike was very different from Royâ€™s Peak.</p><p><figure><img src=/img/May12-16/roberts_view.jpg></figure>Â </p><p>It was also a 5 star hard rated track on All Trails and though shorter (12.3km) with less elevation gain (540 meters) this trail was expected to take 5h20 mins to complete. We were 2 of 4 people on this amazing trail that day.</p><p><figure><img src=/img/May12-16/bridge_roberts.jpg></figure>Â </p><p>The track is really intricate and beautiful. It takes you through rainforest, across bridges, over slabs of slick rock, across many streams and ends with a full view of the Franz-Joseph Glacier, and accompanying waterfalls.</p><p><figure><img src=/img/May12-16/will_halfway_view.jpg></figure>Â </p><p><figure><img src=/img/May12-16/begin_roberts.jpg></figure>Â </p><p>A large part of Will&rsquo;s love for this trail were the multiple creeks we had to cross. He loved the challenge, and the nostalgic childhood feeling.</p><p><figure><img src=/img/May12-16/will_creek.jpg></figure>Â </p><p><figure><img src=/img/May12-16/bridge2.jpg></figure>Â </p><p>We stayed at the view point for another snacky lunch but eventually had to leave for what would be a slow return.</p><p><figure><img src=/img/May12-16/lunch_robs.jpg></figure>Â </p><p><figure><img src=/img/May12-16/glacier.jpg></figure>Â </p><p>Objectively the trail was a lot of fun, however, given our limited amount of stretching throughout this portion of the trip, my left leg/knee was in rough shape, I was mostly doing the hike on my right leg which obviously became very difficult on hour 3 of the hike. I fell more than once on the incredibly slippy terrain.</p><p><figure><img src=/img/May12-16/will_hike.jpg></figure>Â </p><p>A long portion of the hike is inclined smooth rock slab with moss, and given the rain from the night before, it was hazardous. Long story short, Will was very helpful in getting me back to the car. But hey, we did it.</p><p><figure><img src=/img/May12-16/sam_view_robs.jpg></figure>Â </p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://swillasnomads.github.io./js/jquery.min.js></script>
