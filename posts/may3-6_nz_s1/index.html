Campervaning in the south island for over 2 weeks has been a highlight of the trip, and non-ironically, my life. The collection of South Island Blog posts will not be short - apologies in advance.</p><p>If you want the crash look at what we&rsquo;ve done, I&rsquo;ve put together a <a href=https://www.traveledmap.com/traveledmap/3sBBHdVayuZDfudHzRgnv9i39Bu2#>map of our route!</a><figure><img src=/img/May3-6/new_zealand_map.jpg></figure> </p><p>I will caveat that Will and I got incredibly lucky with our travels to New Zealand in 3 significant ways.</p><ul><li>We were probably among the first handful of international flights into the country.</li><li>We were visiting during a shoulder season (fall), and post New Zealand School break.</li><li>We caught the tail end of a heatwave, making the fall we were experiencing 5-10 degrees warmer than previous years.</li></ul><p>This meant, we encountered essentially no other travelers at campgrounds, in towns or on hikes. And had great weather on the whole. We would read blog posts, or reviews saying to book in advance, or arrive early because such and such activity or destination is always packed, but that was not our experience. We were able to experience all the beauty of New Zealand without the crowds and without the planning way ahead. We could chase the sun and plan on the fly ☀️.</p><h5 id=first-up-the-van><strong>First up, the van.</strong></h5><p><figure><img src=/img/May3-6/glen_campground.jpg></figure> </p><p>Our selection criteria:</p><ul><li>A van on the cheap end of the spectrum and smallish (would be kinder on the fuel efficiency)</li><li>A bed that would fit Will’s sleeping body</li><li>A self-contained van (a designation that allows you to participate in New Zealand free campgrounds)</li><li>A van that had the ability to heat us up at night.</li></ul><p>We were hesitating between Matt & Dan Campervans and Jucy. We ended up renting from Matt & Dan for the better aesthetic and to support the smaller family-run business. Though the van had a few quirks, we made it work. Enough so, that I was actually sad to leave it behind and travel without it in the north island.</p><p><figure><img src=/img/May3-6/van.jpg></figure> </p><h3 id=may-4th-get-the-van--go>May 4th: Get the van & go</h3><p>After completing our first grocery shop for the van in Christchurch, we headed for Mount Cook. It was a long drive, but we were rewarded with our first glimpses of beautiful New Zealand scenery and our introduction to holiday parks. Holiday parks are the fancy campgrounds, coasting between 40-60NZD/night, they come equipped with showers, kitchens and lounges (of varying nicessness). The discovery of fully equipped kitchens at campgrounds just added to our awe of New Zealand infrastructure (they also have incredible washroom facilities).</p><p><figure><img src=/img/May3-6/drive_mount_cook.jpg></figure> </p><h3 id=may-5th-mount-cook>May 5th: Mount Cook</h3><p>We woke up in the morning and made our way to the Hooker Valley Track. Our little intro into National parks of New Zealand. This 3 hour walk took our breath away. Staring at glaciers, glacier formed valleys and landscapes that made us think we were in a Lord of Rings movie, Will and I were in awe. I would highly recommend this track to anyone who’s visiting New Zealand.</p><p><div id=myCarousel class="carousel slide" data-ride=carousel><ol class=carousel-indicators><li data-target=#myCarousel data-slide-to=0 class=active></li><li data-target=#myCarousel data-slide-to=1></li><li data-target=#myCarousel data-slide-to=2></li><li data-target=#myCarousel data-slide-to=3></li><li data-target=#myCarousel data-slide-to=4></li></ol><div class=carousel-inner><div class="item active"><img src=/img/May3-6/hooker_valley_track.jpg alt style=width:100%></div><div class=item><img src=/img/May3-6/will_hooker.jpg alt style=width:100%></div><div class=item><img src=/img/May3-6/bridge_hooker.jpg alt style=width:100%></div><div class=item><img src=/img/May3-6/glacier_hooker.jpg alt style=width:100%></div><div class=item><img src=/img/May3-6/landscape_hooker_valley.jpg alt style=width:100%></div></div><a class="left carousel-control" href=#myCarousel data-slide=prev><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left"></span>

There are so many hikes to be done, even just being in the parking lot is beautiful. But unfortunately after our morning walk, we were booking it back to the coast.</p><p><figure><img src=/img/May3-6/lunch_mount_cook.jpg></figure> </p><h3 id=may-6th-south-east-coast-moeraki-to-curio-bay>May 6th: South-East Coast (Moeraki to Curio Bay)</h3><p>A straight drive between Moeraki and Curio Bay takes 3.5hours. However with my planned stops, that brought the driving time closer to 4.5hrs and that didn’t include the time needed to actually visit said stops. Needless to say, our day was charged. But we still made time for a nice oatmeal breakfast with a view.</p><p><figure><img src=/img/May3-6/moeraki_campsite.jpg></figure> </p><h5 id=tunnel-beach><strong>Tunnel Beach</strong></h5><p>We were expecting to drive by the ocean and see a large rock arch with beach and water. But we get there and we’re miles above sea level and a sign tells us it’s an hour there and back. We set a 20min timer (cause we&rsquo;re on a site seeing schedule, people!) and begin our descent to glimpse this geographical site. It was a very steep downhill, which satisfyingly unveiled tunnel beach to us as we walked. And the whole thing culminates in narrow stone steps through a tunnel to bring you to the beach.</p><p><figure><img src=/img/May3-6/tunnel_point.jpg></figure> </p><h5 id=nugget-point-lighthouse><strong>Nugget Point Lighthouse</strong></h5><p>Another short walk to a beautiful view of large “nugget” shaped rocks jutting out from the water near a lighthouse built on lichen covered stone. It didn’t hurt that we saw some whales way out in the distance. Definitely wished I had found room in my luggage for my binoculars.</p><p><figure><img src=/img/May3-6/nugget_point.jpg></figure> </p><h5 id=cathedral-caves><strong>Cathedral Caves</strong></h5><p>Here’s one thing we should have researched, it’s only open during low tide, and we missed the window…</p><h5 id=mclean-falls><strong>McLean Falls</strong></h5><p>A lovely waterfall which allowed Will to start working on his long exposure photography.</p><p><figure><img src=/img/May3-6/long_exposure_waterfall.jpg></figure> </p><p><figure><img src=/img/May3-6/will_shooting_waterfall.jpg></figure> </p><h5 id=curio-bay>Curio Bay</h5><p>A scenic area of the catlins, that contains a very illusive penguin we didn’t have the pleasure of seeing, but since the cathedral coves had been removed from our schedule we were able to catch the sunset for our first van cooked dinner.</p><p><figure><img src=/img/May3-6/dinner_curio.jpg></figure> </p><p><figure><img src=/img/May3-6/bed_curio.jpg></figure> </p><p><figure><img src=/img/May3-6/will_journal_curio.jpg></figure> </p><p>This night would be our first night of freedom camping, in essentially a parking lot we were told got really busy, but of course, we were the only ones there. I made Will come to the bathrooms with me cause the isolation was creepy (though realistically, not much to be scared of in New Zealand, they don’t even have bears).</p><p><figure><img src=/img/May3-6/breaky_curio.jpg></figure> </p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://swillasnomads.github.io./js/jquery.min.js></script>
