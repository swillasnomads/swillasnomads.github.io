We knew we were leaving the hospitality of Willâ€™s family in Vancouver on the 13th, but until the 12th, we didnâ€™t yet know where we were going to stop along our drive. We crafted a plan over lunch at the Naam in Kitsilano. We would sleep our first night in Astoria, Oregon. Our second night in Medford, Oregon. And we would book our last nightâ€™s accomodation once in Medford since we still werenâ€™t sure what we wanted to do for that last night.</p><h3 id=astoria-oregon>Astoria, Oregon</h3><p>We left Vancouver around 10am with a packed lunch. We intended to stop for lunch in Seattle and do some very limited sightseeing. We were very fortunate to hit a warm sunny day for our travels (at this point in our road trip, we had ditched the winter coats and boots, it felt weird to be moving around in shoes in the middle of February).</p><p><div style=position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden><iframe src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/zjJoNcbdgAw style=position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0 allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe></div>Â </p><p>The border crossing went really smoothly, no protests were blocking the crossing and our car didnâ€™t get searched (super grateful since our car does take quite a bit of time to pack and unpack). Though the border agent was very curious about the intention of our 6 week stay and how we were managing that much time off work. We parted ways by telling him we did not have firearms with which to protect ourselves onboard and that yes we were vaccinated even though he didnâ€™t require proof. Welcome to America.</p><p>Our stop in Seattle was short and sweet. We first struggled to find parking near Pike Place market but finally managed. Then, we thought weâ€™d get a drink from the original starbucks and eat our meal by the water, only to realize the line for said starbucks was way too long and we actually didnâ€™t care that much. So, our stop was just Will and myself eating our cheese and crackers on a park bench, with the sun hitting our pale faces.</p><p><figure><img src=/img/Feb12-15/selfie_lunch.jpg></figure>Â </p><p>The rest of the drive was mostly uneventful, though we did learn that in Oregon it is illegal to pump your own gas, an attendant always does it (it was a scheme developed in the 70s to create more jobs and it never left).</p><p>We pulled into Astoria sometime around 5pm and checked into the very quirky Atomic Motel. I want to quickly thank my aunt, Valerie and uncle, Ryan for the recommendation / insistence that we drive along the Oregon coast and specifically stop in Astoria. The town was absolutely splendid, we had a blast. We were spoiled by a beautiful sunset upon our arrival, we feasted at a typical American diner for dinner (all day breakfast!) and were able to see the beautiful city landscape from the Astoria Tower before heading out the next day. Not to mention I think I tasted my favourite cider of all time from a local cidery (Reveille).</p><p><h4>Beautiful Astoria</h4><div id=myCarousel class="carousel slide" data-ride=carousel><ol class=carousel-indicators><li data-target=#myCarousel data-slide-to=0 class=active></li><li data-target=#myCarousel data-slide-to=1></li><li data-target=#myCarousel data-slide-to=2></li><li data-target=#myCarousel data-slide-to=3></li><li data-target=#myCarousel data-slide-to=4></li><li data-target=#myCarousel data-slide-to=5></li><li data-target=#myCarousel data-slide-to=6></li><li data-target=#myCarousel data-slide-to=7></li></ol><div class=carousel-inner><div class="item active"><img src=/img/Feb12-15/sam_push_cart.jpg alt style=width:100%></div><div class=item><img src=/img/Feb12-15/astoria_bridge.jpg alt style=width:100%></div><div class=item><img src=/img/Feb12-15/astoria_view.jpg alt style=width:100%></div><div class=item><img src=/img/Feb12-15/astoria_tower.jpg alt style=width:100%></div><div class=item><img src=/img/Feb12-15/fire_sunset.jpg alt style=width:100%></div><div class=item><img src=/img/Feb12-15/will_astoria.jpg alt style=width:100%></div><div class=item><img src=/img/Feb12-15/pig.jpg alt style=width:100%></div><div class=item><img src=/img/Feb12-15/cider.jpg alt style=width:100%></div></div><a class="left carousel-control" href=#myCarousel data-slide=prev><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left"></span>

However, itâ€™s nothing to write home about. What we do have to write about is our unfortunate experience of spending a good half hour grocery shopping for our dinner (microwave meal combo) and lunch for the next day, only to pull up to the cash and have every card we own be declined. They didnâ€™t accept credit cards nor it seems our canadian debit cards. At this point in our trip we didnâ€™t have any US cash. So, we had to awkwardly leave all our groceries and set out to another store to start again. Not the funnest activity when youâ€™re tired and
hungry ðŸ˜“.</p><p>After dining on our mix of three microwave dinners, we unwound with some Olympics, and almost forgot that we hadnâ€™t booked anything for our next night. We briefly debated between Napa and an Inn in Loyalton, California and landed on Loyalton since it would be cheaper and closer to our end destination. In retrospect, this tired decision from our motel bed was the best we made so far.</p><h3 id=loyalton-california>Loyalton, California</h3><p><figure><img src=/img/Feb12-15/sam_diary.jpg></figure>Â </p><p>The Gilded Drifter Inn is worth the detour off the beaten path. It may even be worth a repeat visit in the future. Will and I could not get over the beauty and careful design of this Inn. It transported us into another world, a Great Gatsby world.</p><p><figure><img src=/img/Feb12-15/room.jpg></figure>Â </p><p>The Inn is nestled in the Sierra Valley and offered us sweeping views of the valley and mountains beyond while also having such a charming interior design that there was really no need to go outside (though we did, briefly).</p><p><figure><img src=/img/Feb12-15/view_sierra.jpg></figure>Â </p><p>The Inn also gave us access to a kitchen, a main floor living room and all the books you could ever want. It also didnâ€™t hurt that we were the only guests of the Inn that night, so we had the whole house to ourselves (along with some ghosts, no doubt). We read, played wingspan (Will wonâ€¦ ðŸ™„), ate our left over spaghetti, and dreamt of coming back to the Inn with multiple friends to have a large themed murder mystery party.</p><p><figure><img src=/img/Feb12-15/will_book.jpg></figure>Â </p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://swillasnomads.github.io./js/jquery.min.js></script>
