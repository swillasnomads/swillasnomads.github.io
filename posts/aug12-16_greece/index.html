Will and I didnâ€™t quite know what to expect because we lazily allowed our host to plan out our whole itinerary. And for that and so much more we are so thankful to Tommy, who planned out a really special sÃ©jours in Athens and accompanying cities for us. But before diving into the details, we need to thank our gracious hosts, Bill and Mary, for so warmly welcoming us into their home.</p><p><figure><img src=/img/Aug12-16/everyone.jpg></figure>Â </p><p>We had 5 nights scheduled in Athens, but upon landing Tommy suggested we go to the Peloponnese for 2 of those nights. He said (rightly so), that you donâ€™t need more than a day to visit Athens - and so why not get an incredibly unique experience?</p><p><figure><img src=/img/Aug12-16/will_tommy_village.jpg></figure>Â </p><p>While exploring the region, we would be staying in Billâ€™s childhood village, Sagkas. Once a thriving village with its own school (granted Bill states there were only two teachers, grades 1-3 on the first floor and 4-6 on the second floor) is now much reduced in size. The last bar didnâ€™t survive the pandemic. Nevertheless, Will and I loved our time in Sagkas. It is oddly peaceful, being so secluded while also being able to hear next door neighbours extremely clearly. And the mountainous scenery is so lovely to wake up to. Iâ€™d highly recommend it, though the village has no hotelâ€¦</p><p><figure><img src=/img/Aug12-16/village_night.jpg></figure>Â </p><p>However, visiting larger nearby cities would be feasible for all tourists. Mainly, Nafplion and Dimitsana.</p><p><figure><img src=/img/Aug12-16/sam_will_flag.jpg></figure>Â </p><p>Nafplion had stunning sea side views, and a famous hike up a thousand steps (really only 857 says google) to the Fortress of Palamidi, built by the venetians.</p><p><figure><img src=/img/Aug12-16/nafpoli.jpg></figure>Â </p><p>Though we never completed the journey up the mountain, I needed to have fresh legs for our hike the next day in Dimitsana. And what a hike it was.</p><p><figure><img src=/img/Aug12-16/dimi.jpg></figure>Â </p><p>We didnâ€™t really know what we were getting ourselves into since this was also uncharted territory for Tommy but we were all quite pleasantly surprised. The hike along the valley is beautiful, and mercifully mostly shaded from the very hot sun. Better than the shade are the monasteries.</p><p><figure><img src=/img/Aug12-16/will_tommy_hike.jpg></figure>Â </p><p>One in particular (monastery of Philosophos), is so well hidden in the rock, we almost missed it. Turns out it was built during the Ottoman occupation to continue teaching young greek boys. It is built into the cliff itself. A wild engineering feat.</p><p><figure><img src=/img/Aug12-16/hidden_monastery.jpg></figure>Â </p><p>An argument could potentially be made that it is not structurally sound anymore, but who am I to say? Iâ€™m not an engineer.</p><p><figure><img src=/img/Aug12-16/structure_monestary.jpg></figure>Â </p><p>And I was extremely glad to be able to walk through the ruins.</p><p><figure><img src=/img/Aug12-16/will_sam_monastery.jpg></figure>Â </p><p>We could have kept going on the hike to yet another cliffside monastery, but our will was ebbing and we decided seeing it from afar was good enough. Tommy has to complete the whole thing one day and tell us how it is.</p><p><figure><img src=/img/Aug12-16/other_monastery.jpg></figure>Â </p><p>I also want to quickly mention that we had some lovely swims in Greece, but never brought our phones with us. The water was so clear and warm, definitely no more need for a wetsuit. The only downside was Will getting stung by a jellyfish ðŸ˜£â€¦</p><p><figure><img src=/img/Aug12-16/will_face.jpg></figure>Â </p><p>Amongst all the incredible things we saw in Greece, spending time with Tommy and his family was the best. It probably didnâ€™t hurt that there always seemed to be the most incredible food associated with the gatherings.</p><p><figure><img src=/img/Aug12-16/family_lunch.jpg></figure>Â </p><p>The conversations flowed and so did the wine (well mostly beer). What more could you ask for? Great food and even better company - Yamas!</p><p><figure><img src=/img/Aug12-16/restaurant_dinner.jpg></figure>Â </p><p>The post wouldnâ€™t be complete without a bunch of pictures of ruins youâ€™ve seen depicted so many times throughout your life - the Acropolis. So here goes:</p><p><div id=myCarousel class="carousel slide" data-ride=carousel><ol class=carousel-indicators><li data-target=#myCarousel data-slide-to=0 class=active></li><li data-target=#myCarousel data-slide-to=1></li><li data-target=#myCarousel data-slide-to=2></li><li data-target=#myCarousel data-slide-to=3></li><li data-target=#myCarousel data-slide-to=4></li></ol><div class=carousel-inner><div class="item active"><img src=/img/Aug12-16/parthenon.jpg alt style=width:100%></div><div class=item><img src=/img/Aug12-16/acropolis_ladies.jpg alt style=width:100%></div><div class=item><img src=/img/Aug12-16/will_acropolis.jpg alt style=width:100%></div><div class=item><img src=/img/Aug12-16/zeus.jpg alt style=width:100%></div><div class=item><img src=/img/Aug12-16/athens_view.jpg alt style=width:100%></div></div><a class="left carousel-control" href=#myCarousel data-slide=prev><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left"></span>

<span class=sr-only>Next</span></a></div>Â </p><p>What I will share is our favourite fact we learned with our free online audio guide. The parthenon was constructed with optical illusion tricks to make it seem perfectly straight and grand. All the pillars are leaning towards each other, if you drew out a straight line they would eventually touch. The pillars in the corners are larger than the rest, and they all bulge imperceptibly in the middle to give the illusion of grandeur. There is no straight line in the Parthenon ðŸ¤¯! Every section of each pillar is cut to measure, not one is the same as the other - Perfectionism to the nth degree.</p><p>Oh and shout out to our first class experience while flying to Greece. It was sublime. And will most likely never happen again.</p><p><figure><img src=/img/Aug12-16/first_class_meal.jpg></figure>Â </p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://swillasnomads.github.io./js/jquery.min.js></script>
